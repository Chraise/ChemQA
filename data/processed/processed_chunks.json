Herein, we present the mechanistic insight underlying the electrochemical synthesis of deprotonated anion of H2O2 HO2 via 2eoxygen reduction by ultrathin Ni-benzenedicarboxylic acid NiBDC, guided by its thickness-dependent performance and pH-induced reconstruction behavior. The real active species are identiﬁed as alkaline- reconstructed β-NiOH2 that is chemically coupled with 1,4-benzenedi- carboxylic acid residual ligand. The hybrid catalyst is characterized to exhibit an optimized surface electronic structure, which improves the intrinsic activity and selectivity. Operando characterization and theoretical simulations further reveal that the residual ligand functionalization signiﬁcantly boosts the for- mation and facilitates the adequate binding of OOH intermediates. Thus, the ligand-functionalized NiOH2 exhibits high HO2 selectivity 90 in 0.1 M KOH across a broad current density up to 200 mA cm2. Moreover, high HO2 production rate of 13.7 mol gcat 1 h1 with signiﬁcant accumulation of 2.0 wt. HO2 under alkaline conditions is achieved at 200 mA cm2 over 100 h, sug- gesting the promising potential for large-scale electrosynthesis of HO2 in industrial applications. Hydrogen peroxide H2O2 ﬁnds widespread applications across var- ious industries, including textile bleaching, pharmaceuticals, waste- water treatment, chemicals, energy carriers, and semiconductor manufacturing, with a current market value of around 3.5 billion USD, growing at a 5 compound annual growth rate. Therefore, the devel- opment of green, efﬁcient, and economically viable methods for H2O2 production is of great signiﬁcance13. Currently, the predominant production of H2O2 relies on the traditional anthraquinone method46, however, it is constrained by environmental concerns, complex pro- cesses, intensive energy consumption, hazardous materials usage, and the necessity of stabilizers during transportation7,8. The renewable energy-powered electrochemical oxygen reduction ORR via the two- electron 2e transfer pathway offers a green, efﬁcient and economic approach for distributed on-demandon-site H2O2 generation, thereby signiﬁcantly mitigating expenses and risks associated with transportation and storage911. Especially, the 2eORR under an alka- line environment exhibits enhanced catalytic activity and optimized selectivity towards the deprotonated anion of H2O2 HO2 due to the pH effect on the catalytic process and ORR mechanism12. It is worth noting that HO2 is particularly suitable for applications where the Received: 10 July 2024 Accepted: 26 May 2025 Check for updates 1State Key Laboratory of Chemical Resource Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, China. 2Hong Kong Quantum AI Lab, AIRInnoHK of Hong Kong Government, Hong Kong SAR 999077, China. 3Faculty of Maritime and Transportation, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, China. 4College of Materials Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310014, China. 5Department of Chemistry, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR 999077, China. 6These authors contributed equally: Tianyu Zhang, Weibo Wang. e-mail: zxguohku.hk; ljfmail.buct.edu.cn Nature Communications 2025 16:5240 1 1234567890:,; 1234567890:,; separation of peroxide from alkaline is unnecessary13.

For example, biomass valorization and pulp bleaching require both high pH 11.6 and high concentration 1 wt. of peroxide14,15. Metal-organic frameworks MOFs are widely recognized as pro- mising electrodes for electrochemical H2O2 generation, owing to their exceptional features, such as large speciﬁc surface area, adjustable porosities, periodic active sites, and composition diversity16,17. How- ever, their electrocatalytic performance is usually thickness- dependent due to their limited electrical conductivity, restricted mass permeability, and active centers blocked by the organic ligands or residual solvents. Therefore, the development of ultrathin 2D MOFs, with maximized exposure of unsaturated metal sites and enhanced masselectron transport, is highly desirable18,19. Nonetheless, potential in-situ reconstructions of the electrocatalysts, especially for MOFs with weak coordination bonds between metal nodes and organic linkers, hinder the identiﬁcation of intrinsic catalytic species and the mechanistic investigation of key effects2024. Additionally, the water hydrolysis of MOFs under the alkaline environment is also non- negligible25. This aspect is often ignored and overshadowed by the initial charging current spike, leading to a misleading declaration of stable MOF electrocatalyst based solely on the minimal performance difference observed during long-term test26,27. Although the recon- struction phenomenon in FeCoNi based-MOFs for alkaline oxygen evolutions, including partial28 and complete29 reconstruction, has gained widespread recognition, its investigation in 2e- ORR is rarely explored30. Herein, we focused on the 2e- ORR of Ni3OH2BDC2H2O4 NiBDC, where BDC represents 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate for HO2 - production. The choice of a Ni-based MOF was based on its advanta- geous features, including tunable electronic structure, moderate binding afﬁnity for oxygen intermediates, and stability in alkaline conditions31. By optimizing the dissolution-reprecipitation rate during the transformation of NiOH2 precursors, we successfully obtained NiBDC with a wide range of thicknesses, including ultrathin utn-, 6 nm, thin tn-, 24 nm, thick tk-, 90 nm, and bulk b-, 120 nm NiBDC. The as-prepared NiBDC exhibits thickness-dependent 2e- ORR performance with thinner layers demonstrating better performance. Combined with in-situ and ex-situ characterizations, we revealed that the surface partially reconstructed BDC-functionalized NiOH2 derived from utn-NiBDC is the real active species for 2e- ORR. More- over, operando Raman and ATR-FTIR spectra, along with theoretical simulations, identiﬁed different rate-determining steps RDS between utn-NiBDC and ultrathin NiOH2, indicating the signiﬁcant impact of the residual BDC functionalization on boosting the proton-involved steps and providing appropriate binding for the OOH intermediate, thereby ensuring enhanced 2e- ORR performance. As a result, the utn- NiBDC exhibits promising 2e- ORR performance at an industrial cur- rent density of 200 mA cm-2 and a high HO2 - production rate of 13.7 mol gcat -1 h-1 with 92 HO2 - selectivity in a ﬂow cell, with stability maintained over 100 h. The HO2 - concentration accumulated after 6 h reached 2.0 wt., which is sufﬁcient to meet the requirements for biomass valorization. Results and discussion Synthesis of utn-NiBDC",

The HO2 - concentration accumulated after 6 h reached 2.0 wt., which is sufﬁcient to meet the requirements for biomass valorization. Results and discussion Synthesis of utn-NiBDC and its 2eORR performance The synthesis of utn-NiBDC was achieved by using NiOH2 Supple- mentary Fig. 1 as Ni source in a mixed solution of water and dime- thylformamide Fig. 1a. By precisely adjusting the dissolution and reprecipitation rates through facile regulation of the solution ratio between water and dimethylformamide, NiBDC with varying thick- nesses could be readily obtained. The key to the synthesis of ultrathin NiBDC lies in the utilization of a low percentage of water, which effectively retards the leaching of Ni2 ions by suppressing the release rate of protons from BDC, an organic ligand known for its weak acidic nature. Thus, the corresponding low local Ni2 concentration leads to a speciﬁc crystal orientation growth, favoring the formation of utn- NiBDC32. Transmission electron microscopy TEM images show clearly NiBDC morphological variation with thickness ranging from ultrathin Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 2a, thin Fig. 1c, thick Fig. 1d, and bulk Supplementary Fig. 3a nanoribbons, demonstrat- ing that the growth direction of the MOF was restricted with the rational control on Ni2 releasing rate. The thickness of utn-, tn-, tk-, and b-NiBDC are conﬁrmed as 6, 24, 90, and 120 nm, respectively, as revealed by the atomic force microscopy AFM Fig. 1eg and Supplementary Fig. 3b. The number of layers for utn-NiBDC is about 7 based on the crystal structure33. Moreover, the powder X-ray dif- fractometer XRD patterns Supplementary Fig. 2b of all three NiBDC samples agree well with the standard Ni3OH2BDC2H2O42H2O JCPDS card No. 35-1677, conﬁrming their single-crystalline nature. The peak intensity ratio between the 100101 plane reduces, and the characteristic peaks broaden as the thickness of NiBDC decreases, demonstrating successful regulation of the crystal growth orientation of NiBDC through our strategy. The electrocatalytic 2e- ORR of the NiBDC with different thick- nesses was examined in O2-saturated KOH 0.1 M using a rotating ring- disk electrode RRDE with a collection efﬁciency of 0.424 Supple- mentary Fig. 4. All NiBDC samples follow preferentially 2e- ORR reaction pathway Fig. 1h, while utn-NiBDC shows a relatively high ring current with optimized HO2 - selectivity of 90 Fig. 1i, higher than that of tn- 77, tk- 68, and b-NiBDC 67. The 2e- Tafel slope of utn-NiBDC 118 mV dec-1 is lower than those of other NiBDC samples, indicating its faster reaction kinetics Supplementary Fig. 5. The cor- responding electrons transferred number n and Faradaic efﬁciency FE during the reaction are further calculated Supplementary Fig. 6a, suggesting a clear thickness-dependent 2e- ORR performance relationship Supplementary Fig. 6b.

The utn-NiBDC exhibits the lar- gest electrochemical surface area ECSA, further verifying the suc- cessful thickness manipulation of NiBDC Supplementary Fig. 7. More importantly, the activity and selectivity of utn-NiBDC are well main- tained after both 10k cycles accelerated degradation test in RRDE Fig. 1j and 7 h on-site H-type cell chronoamperometry test Supple- mentary Fig. 8, indicating good electrocatalytic stability of utn-NiBDC. Investigation on the reconstruction of utn-NiBDC Although the utn-NiBDC exhibits promising stability, the electro- catalytic performance stability of the MOFs does not guarantee their chemical stability, hindering the identiﬁcation of active species. Spe- ciﬁcally for Ni-based materials, Ni-MOF34, oxygen vacancy Ov enri- ched NiO35, NiOH2 36 and β-NiOOH37 are all reported as active species for 2e- ORR. The chronoamperometry curve of utn-NiBDC exhibits a pronounced response at 0.2 V, characterized by a remarkable initial surge within the ﬁrst 15 s followed by a sustained plateau Supple- mentary Fig. 9, validating a rapid activation process38. After recon- struction, the selectivity of utn-NiBDC initially increases and then stabilizes during the detachment of residual BDC ligand, indicating the existence of an optimal surface BDC ratio. To investigate the possible reconstruction phenomenon and its corresponding mechanism, we characterized the post-reacted utn-NiBDC after a spe- ciﬁc reaction time PR-utn-NiBDC. TEM images revealed defect-rich morphologies of PR-utn-NiBDC with no discernible changes in thickness Supplementary Fig. 10, indicating the occurrence of NiBDC recon- struction during the reaction. As shown in Fig. 2a, complete structure transformation from MOF into β-NiOH2 can be observed in XRD pat- terns of PR-utn-NiBDC after a reaction time of 1 h in 0.1 M KOH. It is worth noting that the reconstruction occurs in all NiBDC with different thicknesses Supplementary Fig. 11, demonstrating that the above- measured performance of NiBDC reﬂects the properties of the recon- structed catalysts. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 11d, utn-NiBDC exhibits the lowest charge transfer resistance, indicating the enhanced ORR performance of ultrathin catalysts may originate from the more Article https:doi.org10.1038s41467-025-60467-0 Nature Communications 2025 16:5240 2 Fig. 1 Thickness-performance relationship. a Schematic illustration for ultrathin NiBDC fabrication. bd TEM images and eg AFM images inset is the corre- sponding height proﬁle measured along the dashed line of b, e utn-NiBDC, c, f tn- NiBDC, and d, g tk-NiBDC. h Polarization curves of Ni-based MOF catalysts recor- ded at 1600 rpm and a scan rate of 5 mV s-1, together with the detected HO2 - cur- rents on the ring electrode upper panel at a ﬁxed potential of 1.2 V vs. RHE 100 iR-corrected.

Extended reaction time further conﬁrms β-NiOH2 as the ﬁnal and real active species. Moreover, the reconstruction receded as the pH of electrolytes decreased Fig. 2b, with the activity and selec- tivity dropping rapidly Supplementary Fig. 12a, b. Even after a 12 h chronoamperometry test at 0.2 V, the XRD pattern of PR-utn-NiBDC at pH 9 agrees well with the MOF crystalline Supplementary Fig. 12c, verifying that the reconstruction mechanism in 2e- ORR potential region 0.8 to 0.2 V vs. RHE is pH-dependent. This observation agrees with the fact that oxidation potentials of Ni2Ni3 are approximately 1.3 V vs. RHE42, thereby excluding the possibility of NiOOH as active sites within this speciﬁc potential range 0.8 to 0.2 V vs. RHE. To further investigate the pH-induced reconstruction mechanism, we directly treated utn- NiBDC at 0.1 M KOH utn-NiBDCKOH. Time-dependent XRD patterns Fig. 2c demonstrate that utn-NiBDC undergoes reconstruction upon electrolyte contact, as evidenced by the reduction of MOF peaks within 1 min and a transformation from amorphous to crystalline β-NiOH2 over time. Notably, utn-NiBDCKOH 1 min shows no obvious increase in current in the chronoamperometry test, further conﬁrming the pH- induced reconstruction mechanism. Moreover, the reconstructed PR- utn-NiBDC exhibits a higher ring current than utn-NiBDC in 0.1 M PBS, demonstrating the effectiveness of the reconstruction strategy Sup- plementary Fig. 13. Inspired by the fact that catalyst reconstruction primarily involves the ligand replacement from BDC to OH in Ni coordination, the BDC ligand behaviors during the alkaline-induced reconstruction were explored. Given the signiﬁcant sensitivity of the C, H, and O elements in the BDC ligand to environmental inﬂuences, precisely quantifying its detachment behavior presents a challenge. Consequently, we employed a Cl-substituted BDC-based utn-NiBDC Cl-utn-NiBDC for a detailed investigation. As shown in Fig. 2df, elemental mapping of Cl- utn-NiBDC before and after KOH treatment illustrates the persistent presence of Cl, 1.0 at. after 1 h, and 0.5 at. even after a prolonged time of 12 h, indicating the existence of residual BDC ligand after Fig. 2 MOF in-situ reconstruction. a Time-dependent XRD patterns of PR-utn- NiBDC. b pH-dependent XRD patterns of PR-utn-NiBDC. c Time-dependent XRD patterns of utn-NiBDC in 0.1 M KOH.

Moreover, both the utn-NiBDC following KOH treatment and 2e- ORR for 1 h show two new peaks at449 and 1050 cm1 in Raman spectra Fig. 2g, corresponding to the A1gT translational mode and 2nd-order lattice mode of reconstructed Ni-OH43. Meanwhile, the in- and out-of- phase stretching modes of the coordinated carboxylate groups bond with metal centers located at 1618, 1444 cm1 and C-H region of the benzene rings in BDC ligands located at 1139, 865, and 623 cm1 indicate the reconstructed NiOH2 is residual BDC-functionalized44. Similar results are also observed in the Fourier-transform infrared FT- IR spectra Fig. 2h. The remaining peaks at 1383 and 1582 cm-1 suggest the residual BDC, while the new peak at 3650 cm-1 demonstrates the formation of NiOH2 45. The valence state of utn-NiBDC under various treatments was further conﬁrmed by XPS Supplementary Fig. 14. Notably, PR-utn-NiBDC exhibits relatively low Ni binding energy compared to utn-NiBDC and utn-NiBDCKOH, suggesting a reduced valent state of Ni species after 2e- ORR process Fig. 2i. Additionally, no obvious oxidization on Ni can be observed on additional H2O2 without applied voltage utn-NiBDCKOH H2O2 and PR-utn-NiBDC with applied voltage without H2O2 generation injecting N2 instead of O2, excluding the in-situ oxidization of Ni by the interfacial peroxide Supplementary Fig. 15.Based on the above analysis, the active species after reconstruction is identiﬁed as the residual BDC-functionalized ultrathin NiOH2. Identiﬁcation of the role of BDC-functionalization To pinpoint the actual active species and assess the residual BDC role in reconstructed utn-NiBDC during 2e- ORR, an ultrathin NiOH2 utn- NiOH2 nanosheet of similar thickness 7.8 nm to utn-NiBDC 6 nm was obtained for compare Supplementary Fig. 16. X-ray absorption ﬁne structure XAFS spectroscopy46 was performed to investigate the coordination environment and electronic structure of utn-NiBDC, PR- utn-NiBDC, and utn-NiOH2. The Ni K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure XANES spectra of the above samples, along with the refer- ences of Ni foil and NiO, show clearly the electronicvalence structures for Ni Fig. 3a. It is noted that the Ni K-edge XANES spectra of the as- prepared samples exhibit NiO-like features. The inset in Fig. 3a high- lights the pre-edge features of Ni K-edge XANES spectra, in which the risen edge of the PR-utn-NiBDC is slightly lower than those of utn- NiBDC and utn-NiOH2, clearly indicating the unique electronic structure of the Ni with residual BDC functionalization and H2O2 reduction. Fourier-transformed FT k3-weighted extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure EXAFS spectra were employed to further analyze the coordination environment of the samples.

Figure 3b illus- trates that the peak area of PR-utn-NiBDC at 1.6 Å associated with Ni-O path is signiﬁcantly smaller than that of utn-NiBDC and utn-Ni OH2, demonstrating a lower oxygen coordination number. This observation aligns with the wavelet transform Supplementary Fig. 17. Quantitative least-square EXAFS curve-ﬁtting parameters Supplementary Fig. 1822 and Supplementary Table 2 reveal a reduced oxygen coordination number in PR-utn-NiBDC about 5.85 compared to utn-NiBDC 5.99 and utn-NiOH2 6.21, implying that a single carboxyl group of the residual BDC is coordinated with the Ni. Additionally, the inﬂuence of existing Ov is eliminated by consistent electron paramagnetic reso- nance EPR spectra between PR-utn-NiBDC and utn-NiOH2 Fig. 3c.

Moreover, the possible active species of NiOH2 with intentionally added BDC and NiO were excluded by testing the coun- terparts Supplementary Fig. 26. Exploration of the mechanism The catalytic activity and selectivity of 2e- reduction of O2 to HO2 - at pH11.6 are associated with the binding energy of the key reaction intermediate OOH49. For catalysts with weak OOH adsorption, O2 activation Eq. 1 is the rate-limiting step RDS, while for those with strong OOH binding, OOH desorption Eq. 2 becomes the RDS. O2 H2O e ! OOH OH ð1Þ OOH e ! HO 2 pH 11:6 ð Þ ð2Þ It is necessary to avoid excessively strong OOH adsorption, as this favors O-O bond dissociation, leading to the predominant 4e- pathway. Operando Raman spectroscopy was performed spanning 0.8 to 0.2 V vs. RHE to probe the OOH intermediate during the 2e- ORR. A pronounced Raman band at approximately 732 cm-1 appeared at 0.7 V Fig. 3f, attributed to the O-O stretching vibration from OOH bridge- to-bridge adsorption structure on the electrocatalyst surface50, indi- cating the OOH desorption as the RDS. Conversely, utn-NiOH2 dis- plays no evident new peak upon potential decreases Fig. 3g, suggesting O2 activation as the RDS.

As shown in Fig. 3h, a major peak at 1258 cm-1 and a weak peak at 1647 cm-1, attributable to the O-O stretching mode of the surface-adsorbed OOH and H2O species51, respectively, emerged and increased with decreasing potential applied on utn-NiBDC.

However, utn-NiBDC exhibited a much stronger intensity of OOH species than utn-NiOH2, implying that the introduced BDC ligand in the asymmetrical Ni active sites played a dominant role in promoting proton-involved steps to ensure a rapid formation of the key OOH intermediate, thus accelerating the whole kinetics of the 2e- ORR electrolysis. Moreover, a negative peak at around 1468 cm-1 is assigned to the adsorbed O2 species, demon- strating that the lack of active surface-adsorbed oxygen is a critical factor limiting the reaction kinetics in utn-NiOH2 Fig. 3i52. Supple- mentary Fig. 27 illustrates that utn-NiBDC exhibits relatively low charge-transfer and mass-transfer resistances compared to utn- NiOH2 under kinetic-relative regions in operando electrochemical impendence spectra EIS53. The narrower half-width of the char- acteristic peak in Bode plots for utn-NiBDC, relative to utn-NiOH2, signiﬁes accelerated electron transfer and enhanced surface reaction kinetics for OOH intermediates34. To clarify further the mechanistic insight, ﬁrst-principles simula- tions were also performed to rationalize the residual BDC ligand and Ov effect on ultrathin NiOH2 for alkaline 2e- ORR. The computational models for pure NiOH2 p-NiOH2, NiOH2 with Ov Ov-NiOH2, NiOH2 with residual BDC ligand functionalization BDC-NiOH2, and NiOH2 with both OV and BDC Ov-BDC-NiOH2 were built based on the EXAFS ﬁtting results Supplementary Fig. 2831 and Supplemen- tary Data 1. As shown in Fig. 4ad and Supplementary Fig. 32, Article https:doi.org10.1038s41467-025-60467-0 Nature Communications 2025 16:5240 5 signiﬁcant charge redistributions were observed at the Ni-OOH bonding regions, which is likely the origin of the enhanced alkaline 2e- ORR performance. As shown in Supplementary Table 3, the Bader charge transfer between Ni and adsorbed OOH for p-NiOH2 is only 0.09 e, suggesting that the primary interaction is hydrogen bonding rather than coordination. Upon introducing the BDC ligand and oxy- gen vacancies to disrupt the symmetry of NiOH2, the Bader charge transfer increases, indicating the adsorption mode changes from hydrogen bonding to ionic bonding. BDC-NiOH2 exhibits the largest Bader charge transfer of 0.79 e, indicating a strong interaction between Ni and OOH species. Moreover, BDC-NiOH2 exhibits a d-band center closer to the Fermi level -4.06 eV compared to those of Ov-NiOH2 -4.279 eV and Ov-BDC-NiOH2 -4.465 eV, suggesting the optimal alignment of Ni and OOH near the Fermi level in BDC- NiOH2 Supplementary Fig. 33.

Moreover, BDC-NiOH2 exhibits a d-band center closer to the Fermi level -4.06 eV compared to those of Ov-NiOH2 -4.279 eV and Ov-BDC-NiOH2 -4.465 eV, suggesting the optimal alignment of Ni and OOH near the Fermi level in BDC- NiOH2 Supplementary Fig. 33. Recent research highlights that the 2e- ORR efﬁcacy is closely linked to the moderate binding strength of OOH intermediate54. Figure 4e depicts the free energy diagram for the alkaline 2e- ORR pathway at an equilibrium potential of 0.7 V vs. RHE. The free energy difference of OOH for BDC-NiOH2 compared to the ideal value of 3.52 eV is 0.09 eV, which is less than that of p-NiOH2 1.19 eV, Ov-NiOH2 0.83 eV and Ov-BDC-NiOH2 0.64 eV, indi- cating the optimized OOH binding energy after the introduction of residual BDC ligand. Moreover, stepwise reaction barriers for 2e- ORR were analyzed, focusing on O2 activation and OOH desorption. Fig- ure 4f illustrates that the RDS for s-NiOH2 and Ov-NiOH2 is O2 activation, but with the introduction of the BDC ligand, it shifts to OOH desorption, corroborating the operando measurements. Upon considering H2O2 as the ﬁnal product instead of HO2 -, BDC-NiOH2 demonstrates the lowest efﬁciency in 2e- ORR, signifying that utn- NiBDC is uniquely suited for alkaline 2e- ORR processes Supplemen- tary Fig. 34. Moreover, the free energy difference of BDC-NiOH2 between OOH and HO2 - is -1.24 eV, which is lower than that of OOH and O with -0.19 eV, indicating that 2e- ORR process is more favorable Fig. 3g. This free energy difference can be attributed to the idea that Fig. 3 BDC-functionalized active species. a XANES spectra of utn-NiBDC, PR-utn- NiBDC, and utn-NiOH2 at Ni K-edge. b Corresponding FT-EXAFS spectra. c EPR spectra of PR-utn-NiBDC and utn-NiOH2. d Polarization curves of utn-NiBDC, utn- NiOH2, and XC-72 recorded at 1600 rpm and a scan rate of 5 mV s-1, together with the detected HO2 - currents on the ring electrode upper panel at a ﬁxed potential of 1.2 V vs. RHE 100 iR-corrected.

High-rate HO2 electrochemical production A three-compartment ﬂow cell Supplementary Fig. 35 was constructed to evaluate the 2eORR performance and applicability of the utn-NiBDC electrocatalyst towards industrially applied current densities. The utn- NiBDC exhibited signiﬁcantly higher current density than that of utn- NiOH2 Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 36. Notably, 130 mV is saved in utn-NiBDC compared with utn-NiOH2 at the same applied current density of 200 mA cm-2. The HO2 - FE of utn-NiBDC over a range of cur- rent densities from 25 to 200 mA cm-2 remains around 90, surpassing the FE of approximately 40 for utn-NiOH2 Fig. 5b. Beneﬁted from the unique role of the BDC ligand and in-situ reduction by the generated HO2 -, utn-NiBDC achieved high HO2 - production rate of 13.7 mol gcat 1 h1, signiﬁcantly greater than utn-NiOH2 and the state-of-the-art 2eORR- to- HO2 electrocatalyst reported to date Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 37. Moreover, a prolonged stability test for utn-NiBDC at a current density of 200 mA cm-2 shows good durability over 100 h without evi- dent degradation Fig. 5d, highlighting the chemical robustness of the residual BDC ligand functionalized catalyst Supplementary Figs. 3840. Such a device produces HO2 - with a high concentration of 2.0 wt. within 6 h and is maintained stably and continuously in alkaline conditions Fig. 5e. Increasing or decreasing the solution pH cannot yield a higher concentration of HO2 -, due to the trade-off between selectivity and decomposition rate Supplementary Fig. 41. Discussion In summary, we present NiBDC MOF with different thicknesses as highly active alkaline 2eORR electrochemical pre-catalysts prepared by a facile dissolution-reprecipitation procedure. Utn-NiBDC with a thickness of 6 nm exhibits the highest HO2 - electrosynthesis activity among the NiBDC, demonstrating a thickness-performance relation- ship. The real active species is identiﬁed as the residual BDC ligand functionalized ultrathin NiOH2 originated from pH-induced recon- struction, conﬁrmed by the ex-situ XRD patterns and Cl labeling experiment. Moreover, operando characterizations and DFT calcula- tions suggest the introduction of a BDC ligand on NiOH2 can tune the OOH adsorption energies and boost the proton-involved steps. Finally, utn-NiBDC was also evaluated in a ﬂow cell-based alkaline electrolyzer at industrially current density, long stability of 100 h, high FE of 90 and production rate of 13.7 mol gcat 1 h1 was obtained, demonstrating its promising application for hydrogen peroxide pro- duction. Overall, our work highlights the reconstruction of MOF during the 2eORR process. Both the synthetic strategy and the residual ligand effect reported here can guide future MOF pre-catalyst design with improved performance for large-scale hydrogen peroxide production.

The acquired EXAFS data were processed according to the standard procedures using the ATHENA module implemented in the IFEFFIT software packages55. The k3-weighted EXAFS spectra were obtained by subtracting the post-edge background from the overall absorption and then normalizing it to the edge-jump step. Subsequently, k3-weighted χk data of Fe K-edge were Fourier transformed to real R space using a Hanning window dk 1.0 Å-1 to separate the EXAFS contributions from different coor- dination shells. To obtain the quantitative structural parameters around central atoms, the least-squares curve parameter ﬁtting was performed using the ARTEMIS module of the IFEFFIT software packages.

To determine the concentration of Ce4, the absorbance of the solution was mea- sured at 319 nm Supplementary Fig. 8. Thus, the corresponding HO2 - FE can be calculated through the equations: FE HO 2 ð Þ 2 CVF Q FE OH ð Þ 1 FE HO 2 ð Þ where C is the concentration of the H2O2; V is the electrolyte volume; F is the Faraday constant 96485 C mol-1, and Q is the passed charge amount.

Flow cell measurements The ﬂow cell electrolytic device was used for further examining the performance of H2O2 synthesis. The catalyst ink was sprayed onto the 1 cm2 GDL carbon paper YLS-30T as the working electrode the areal mass loading was 0.25 mg cm2 with Nickel foam as the counter elec- trode and an AgAgCl reference electrode. 1 cm2 dioxide materials sustainion membrane X37-60 grade T with a thickness of 50 μm was used as an anion exchange membrane. The electrolyte was used immediately after preparation. The electrolyte was 10 mL 0.1 M KOH in both cathode and anode compartments with a continuous circulation 5 mL min-1 by a peristaltic pump, which is immediately used after preparation. All the tests were under room temperature 25 C. Simultaneously, a continuous ﬂow of O2 or air was introduced into the cell 40 mL min-1. The H2O2 production amount in the electrolyte was quantiﬁed using the Ce4 titration method. The H2O2 faradaic efﬁciency was calculated through the same method of H-type Cell measurement. Theoretical computation Density functional theory DFT calculations were performed to investigate the geometric and electronic structures of residual BDC ligand functionalized, oxygen vacancies induced, or pristine NiOH2 and the mechanism for 2e- ORR by using the Vienna Ab initio Simula- tion package VASP6163. The projected augmented wave PAW potential and generalized gradient approximation GGA of the spin- polarized Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof PBE functional were employed to describe the electron-ion interaction and exchange-correlation energy, respectively6466. The energy cutoff for the plane-wave expansion was set at 450 eV for optimizing calculations of atoms and cell optimization. The Hubbard U DFT U corrections67,68 for 3 d transition metal were set using a U-J value of 6.45 eV for Ni atom69. The DFT-D3 empirical correction method was adopted to describe the van der Waals interactions between the adsorbed atoms and the support70. The construction of the surface model was based on the single crystal of NiOH2 by constructing a 2 2 1 or 2 2 2 supercell. The primitive cell model of NiOH2 was constructed with fully optimized atomic position, cell volume, and cell shape. The vacuum spacing in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the catalyst was at 15 Å. Then, an oxygen vacancy or a BDC ligand was added into the NiOH2 to construct Ov-NiOH2 and BDC-NiOH2, respectively. The slab models were only optimized for the atomic positions. The equilibrium lattice constants were optimized with maximum stress on each atom within 0.05 eV Å-1 under the quasi-Newton algorithm71,72. The initial magnetic moments of Ni atoms were set to be 2 μB, while the spin-polarization effect was also considered. The self-consistent calculations applied a convergence energy threshold of 10-5 eV under the consideration of electronic relaxation to utilize the conjugate-gradient method73. After geometry optimization,",

The self-consistent calculations applied a convergence energy threshold of 10-5 eV under the consideration of electronic relaxation to utilize the conjugate-gradient method73. After geometry optimization, the lattice constants of NiOH2 supercell with 100 atoms are a 12.63 Å, b 12.63 Å, and c 31.25 Å, which should be sufﬁcient. Thus, the Brillouin zone integration was performed using 3 3 1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point sampling for all samples74. The associated Gibbs free energies ΔG of the adsorbates for each electrochemical process are calculated as: ΔG ΔE ΔEZPE TΔS Where the value of ΔE, ΔEZPE, ΔS, and T denotes the changes of DFT energy, the zero-point energy, the entropy, and the temperature, respectively. The calculated energy value of HO2 - is from the NIST National Institute of Standards and Technology Chemistry WebBook, SRD 69. Speciﬁcally, the reactions and energy are calculated based on the computational hydrogen electrode CHE model. The half reaction O2 2 H e H2O2 is analyzed using the CHE model to obtain the energy of H e, which is referenced to ½ H2. Referring to H2O and H2, the energy of diatomic oxygen molecules O2 is obtained as 4.92 eV, and the energy of hydrogen peroxide H2O2 is obtained as 3.67 eV. Thus, the energy of the deprotonated anion of H2O2 HO2 - is calculated as 2.356 eV.

Herein, we realize an efficient ethanol electrosynthesis by coating Cu catalysts with β-hydroxy ketone-based covalent organic polymers COPCOOH, which not only activate CO2 but also balance the CHOCO flux at the catalystelectrolyte interface. The COPCOOH coated Cu NPs CuCOPCOOH exhibits unprecedented FEEtOH of 54.2 in 0.5 M KHCO3, with a partial current density of 121.3 mA cm2. Crucially, using a dilute CO2 feedstock 20 CO2, it retains 40.8 FEEtOH, circumventing energy-intensive CO2 purification. Through systematic experimental characterizations and density functional theory DFT calculations, we elucidate a unique organic motif synergy: carbonyl groups serve as CO2 activation centers, while adjacent hydroxyl groups boost H supply for CO protonation to CHO intermediates. This unique synergy enables a balanced CHOCO flux, thereby creating an optimal environment favoring asymmetric CHOCO coupling and preferentially stabilizing the CHCOH intermediate toward ethanol production. Our investigations establish a universal design paradigm to bypass scaling relations in CO2RR through organic motif synergy, offering atomistic insights into steering complex reaction networks in CO2 electroreduction. INTRODUCTION The use of CO2, water, and renewable electricity as direct feedstocks for synthesizing dense-energy carriers offers a sustainable pathway to decarbonize energy systems while reducing fossil fuel dependence.1,2 Particularly promising in this context is the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction CO2RR, which enables the storage of intermittent renewable energy sources and the production of carbon-neutral fuels and chemicals, such as ethanol.3,4 However, achieving exclusive ethanol generation via the CO2RR remains a substantial challenge rooted in the complex proton-coupled electron transfer PCET process.5,6 Despite substantial progress has been made in catalyst design, the Faradaic efficiency for ethanol FEEtOH still falls short of industrial requirements.7,8 Moreover, nearly all reported CO2RR systems rely on pure CO2, whose production costs 70100 per ton from industrial waste gases significantly undermine process economics.9 To address these limitations, further advances in ethanol-oriented CO2RR electrocatalysts, especially those operating under dilute CO2 streams, are in a pressing need. Beyond manipulating the composition and structure of Cu- based catalysts, rational regulation of interfacial microenviron- ments has emerged as a pivotal strategy to enhance CO2RR performance toward ethanol production.1012 In particular, incorporating organic functional motifs at the reaction interface exerts a profound influence on CO2 to ethanol kinetics by tailoring intermediates adsorption and interfacial water micro- environment.13,14 For instance, superhydrophobic polymers have been shown to elevate the local CO2H2O ratio at the Cu surface, thereby directing the reaction pathway toward ethanol formation.15 Beyond mass transfer control, organic functional motifs can directly",

This mechanism not only enhances CO2 activation kinetics but also holds promise for concentrating CO2 at catalytic sites under dilute feed conditions. However, while hydrophobic organic layers improve CO2 enrichment, they concurrently reduce interfacial water content, leading to insufficient proton availability that hinders the thermodynamically favorable asymmetric CHOCO coupling.19 To address this, recent studies highlight the role of hydroxyl motifs in enabling hydrogen-bond-assisted proton delivery20 and providing extra stabilization capability toward oxygen-containing intermediates in CO2RR systems,21 which are pivotal for ethanol forma- tion.22,23 Building on these insights, it is postulated that integrating dual-functional organic motifscombining carbonyl groups for CO2 activation and hydroxyl groups for proton deliverycould synergistically optimize the interfacial micro- environment toward high-efficiency ethanol production from dilute CO2 streams. In this contribution, we designed a β-hydroxy ketone-based covalent organic polymer COPCOOH overlayer on Cu nanoparticles to address the dual challenges of CO2 activation and proton supply in the ethanol-selective CO2RR under dilute CO2 conditions. The CuCOPCOOH composite achieves an exceptional FEEtOH of 54.2 with an ethanol partial current density jEtOH of 121.3 mA cm2 in neutral electrolyte, while maintaining 40.8 FEEtOH under a dilute CO2 feed 20 CO2. Mechanistic investigations uncover a cooperative interfacial synergy: the carbonyl groups function as a molecular antenna to concentrate CO2 and accelerate CO2 formation, while hydroxyl moieties establish hydrogen-bond interactions that facilitate water dissociation kinetics, ensuring an efficient H supply for CO protonation to CHO. This dual functionality synergistically optimizes the CHOCO ratio and directs the asymmetric CC coupling for ethanol production. By harmonizing CO2 enrichment and proton delivery at the organicinorganic interface, this study pioneers a molecularly tailored approach to valorize waste CO2 streams into sustainable ethanol, bridging the gap between laboratory-scale innovation and industrial feasibility. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Theoretical Predictions on the Functional Motifs Synergy in CO2RR. The investigation begins by employing density functional theory DFT to probe how carbonyl and hydroxyl motifs regulate elementary steps associated with ethanol generation in the CO2RR. Initially, we model the adsorption behavior of CO2 on these COPs: COPOH hydroxyl- only, COPCO carbonyl-only, and COPCOOH dual-func- tional, represented by 1,3-diphenylpropan-1-ol, 1,3-diphenyl- propan-1-one, and 3-hydroxy-1,3-diphenylpropan-1-one, re- spectively.

As shown in Figure 1a, the dual-functional COPCOOH exhibits the strongest CO2 binding 0.126 eV vs 0.103 eV for COPOH and 0.114 eV for COPCO, with adsorption configurations showing cooperative COCO2 and OHCO2 interactions Figure S1. Such synergistic binding not only facilitates CO2 enrichment at the catalytic interface but also weakens the CO bonds of adsorbed CO2, priming it for subsequent activation. Given the critical role of H2O dissociation in generating H for driving CO2 deep reduction,24 we systematically investigate the H2O dissociation kinetics on COP-modified Cu surfaces. Models are constructed by grafting representative COP units onto the thermodynamically favorable Cu 111 surface, designating as Cu111COPCO, Cu111COPOH, and Cu111COPCOOH, respectively Figures S2S4. The free energy diagram Figure 1b reveals a dramatic reduction in the H2O dissociation barrier: 0.31 eV Cu111COPCO 0.14 eV Cu111COPOH 0.11 eV Cu111COPCOOH. This trend confirms that the OH moieties dominate H generation, and the synergistic interplay between CO and OH in COPCOOH shifts H2O dissociation on Cu111 from endothermic to exothermic. To rationalize this synergy, we analyze the atomic configurations of H2O adsorption over these Figure 1.

As presented in Table S1, the HOH linkage elongation aligns with the trend of the energy barrier for water dissociation, supporting the idea that the CO and OH interplay could polarize the HOH bond and expedite its dissociation. Beyond H generation, we further investigate the CO hydrogenation to CHOa critical intermediate for asym- metric CHOCO couplinggiven its thermodynamic pref- erence over CO dimerization.25,26 DFT results Figures S6 S8 reveal that the CO to CHO energy barrier decreases progressively from Cu111COPCO 0.43 eV to Cu111- COPOH 0.40 eV and Cu111COPCOOH 0.14 eV Figure 1c, consistent with the trend of H generation. This suggests that enhanced H flux holds the potential to elevate CHO coverage, thereby creating a kinetically favorable landscape for asymmetric coupling. To validate this, we modeled asymmetric CHOCO coupling on CHO-preloaded Cu111 surfaces: pristine Cu111, Cu111-19CHO one CHO per 3 3 slab, and Cu111-29CHO two CHO Figure S9. Free energy profiles Figure 1d indicate that the asymmetric CHOCO coupling becomes energetically more favorable as CHO coverage increases, confirming that COPCOOH-mediated CHO enrichment thermodynamically steers CC coupling.

Subsequently, to elucidate how CHO governs the selectivity bifurcation between ethanol and ethylene, we scrutinize the reaction energetics of CHCOHa pivotal branching inter- mediate dictating C2 product distribution.21,27,28 Reaction energy landscapes from CHCOH to CCH ethylene pathway, ΔG1 versus CHCHOH ethanol pathway, ΔG2 are mapped across CHO-modified Cu111 surfaces Figure S10. On pristine Cu111, ΔG1 is lower than ΔG2, indicating an intrinsic preference for ethylene formation Figure S11a. However, the incorporation of CHO dramatically reshapes this preference. On Cu111-19CHO, ΔG2 registers at 0.16 eV, nearly matching ΔG1 0.17 eV Figure S11b. Further increasing CHO coverage Cu111-29CHO amplifies this trend, driving ΔG2 drops to 0.21 eV while ΔG1 remains nearly constant at 0.17 eV Figure S11c. We quantify the ethanol selectivity bias using the energy difference descriptor- ΔG2ΔG1, where increasingly negative values signify stronger ethanol preference. As depicted in Figure 1e, the energy disparity becomes more negative with higher CHO coverage, suggesting that CHO enrichment steers the reaction toward ethanol generation. To unravel the mechanistic basis for preferential ethanol formation, we conduct charge distribution analysis of CHCOH adsorption on Cu111 and Cu111-29CHO Figure S12. An intensified charge transfer is observed on Cu111-2 9CHO Figure 1f, indicative of enhanced CHCOH stabilization. Atomic-level electronic configurations reveal that CHO coadsorption induces pronounced charge redistribution within CHCOH Figure 1g, localizing electron density around the C2O1 bond. This electronic reconfiguration shortens the C2O1 bond length from 1.374 Å pristine Cu to 1.371 Å Cu111-29CHO, strengthening the CO linkage and thermodynamically favoring ethanol formation over ethylene. Taken together, these DFT calculations establish that OH and CO moieties in COPCOOH synergistically elevate CHO coverage via carbonyl-mediated CO2 activation and Figure 2. a Schematic procedure for COPs preparation. b FT-IR spectra, and c 13C NMR spectra of COPs.

This elevated CHO coverage not only promotes asymmetric CHOCO coupling but also preferentially reinforces the CO linkage in the CHCOH intermediate, effectively steering the reaction toward ethanol. Design, Synthesis, and Characterization of COPs with Targeted Functional Motifs. As a proof of concept, COPOH, COPCO, and COPCOOH are constructed via a simple aldol reaction. As shown in Figure 2a, COPOHCO is synthesized through the base-catalyzed self-condensation of 1,3,5-triacetyl- benzene TAB. COPCO is obtained via the condensation of TAB and terephthalaldehyde TPA, while COPOH is subsequently derived from COPCO through selective carbonyl reduction using NaBH4.29 The molecular structures of these COPs are verified by Fourier-transform infrared FT-IR spectroscopy and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance 13C NMR analysis.

Noteworthy, COPCOOH exhibits distinct CO 1670 cm1 and OH 3360 cm1 stretching modes, confirming its β-hydroxy ketone architecture. The absence of the OH stretching vibrations in COPCO and the near-complete disappearance of the CO signals in COPOH after NaBH4 reduction align with the designed molecular architectures. Furthermore, the CO and OH stretching vibrations in COPCOOH are red-shifted Figure S13, which can be attributed to the elongation of CO and OH bonds arising from intramolecular hydrogen bonding CO HO within the β-hydroxy ketone framework Figure S14 and Table S2.30,31 The attenuated CO bond strength may enhance its reducibility to COunder electrochemical operation, which contributes to CO2 activation to form CO2 intermediates. 13C NMR Figure 2c further validates the structures: COPCOOH displays both ketone carbonyl δ 175 ppm and hydroxyl-bearing carbons δ 70 ppm, while COPCO retains only carbonyl signals and COPOH shows only hydroxyl-associated carbons. Together, these spectroscopic analyses unambiguously confirm the successful synthesis of target COPs with precise functional motif control. CO2RR Performance over COPs-Coated Cu NPs. With these COPs successfully synthesized, we next evaluate their role in modulating CO2RR kinetics by integrating them with commercial Cu NPs.

Prior to the performance evaluation, these composites were characterized to assess the impact of COPs on their physicochemical characteristics. A combination of SEM, XRD, and XPS analyses Figure S15 and Supplementary Note 1 confirmed that the COP coating does not alter the Cu NPs morphology, crystalline structure, or electronic properties. This eliminates the potential alteration in catalytic performance arising from structural or electronic factors, ensuring that observed catalytic differences are solely attributable to the functional motifs in COPs.

Notably, COPs-coated Cu NPs exhibits suppressed hydrogen evolution reaction HER currents, attributed to enhanced hydro- phobicity reducing water accessibility at the catalyst-electrolyte interface contact angle increase from 46 to 120, Figure S18. Moreover, COPs-coated Cu NPs displays a lower CO2RR current density than pristine Cu NPs, which might be aroused from the sacrificed electrochemical active surface areas ECSA due to polymer coating. This hypothesis is validated by double- layer capacitance Cdl measurements Figure S19 and Table S3, showing nearly halved ECSA for COP-coated catalysts. Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy EIS reveals that COPs-coated Cu NPs exhibits higher charge transfer resistance Figure S20, which can be explained by the inherent insulating nature of these COPs. Next, the CO2RR performance of these COPs-coated Cu NPs is systematically evaluated from 0.8 to 1.6 VRHE with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode, without iR compensation. Figure 3ac summarizes the potential-dependent product distributions on these COPs-coated Cu NPs. As expected, COPs coatings universally suppress the parasitic HER, reducing the Faradaic efficiency of H2 FE H2 by more than 34.5 1.2 VRHE compared to pristine Cu NPs Figures S21 and S22. Meanwhile, C2 product selectivity is significantly enhanced, with the Faradaic efficiency for C2 products FE C2 reaching 44.5 CuCOPCO, 50.7 CuCOPOH, and 73.9 Cu COPCOOH at 1.2 VRHE, far exceeding that of pristine Cu NPs 35.6 Figure S23a. Notably, CuCOPCO exhibits a higher CO Faradaic efficiency FECO than pristine Cu NPs across the entire potential range Figure S23b, which aligns with the carbonyl groups role in facilitating CO2 activation. Of interest, FECO on CuCOPOH and CuCOPCOOH exhibit an inverted trend compared with that of CuCOPCO and Cu NPs. This inversion reflects accelerated CO depletion via hydroxyl- assisted protonation or CC coupling, a behavior consistent with DFT predictions. Moreover, it should be noted that the FEEtOH of CuCOPOH and CuCOPCOOH significantly surpasses that of CuCOPCO Figures 3d and S24, underscoring the pivotal role of hydroxyl motifs in heightening ethanol selectivity.28,32 The dual-func- tional CuCOPCOOH achieves dominance in ethanol produc- tion, reaching an impressive FEEtOH of 54.2 at 1.2 VRHE, with an ethanol partial current density jEtOH of 121.3 mA cm2 Figure 3e, corresponding to a production rate of 257.9 μmol h1cm2 Figure S25. To isolate intrinsic activity from surface area effects, we normalize the jEtOH by ECSA. As shown in Figure S26, the ECSA-normalized jEtOH follows the trend Cu NPs Cu COPCO CuCOPOH CuCOPCOOH, directly linking the C OOH synergy to enhanced intrinsic activity for CO2-to- ethanol conversion.

When benchmarked against state-of-the-art catalysts operating in near-neutral electrolytes, our Cu COPCOOH composite ranks among the top performers in both FEEtOH and jEtOH Figure 3f and Table S4. This superior performance stems from the cooperative interplay of CO- driven CO2 activation and OH-mediated CO protonation, which collectively steers the reaction pathway toward asym- metric CHOCO coupling for ethanol generation. To validate the universal catalytic enhancement of COPCOOH, we integrate it with two well-established CO2RR electrocatalystsAg nanoparticles NPs, CO-selective and Cu2O nanocubes NCs, C2-selective fabrication details in Supplementary Note 2 and Figure S27. For Ag NPs, COPCOOH coating increases FECO along with a decrease in the FEH2 Figure S28, confirming its role in CO2 activation. In the case of pristine Cu2O NCs, the COPCOOH coating shifts selectivity from ethylene-dominated FEEtOH 20, FEEtOH FEethylene ratio fluctuating between 0.4 and 1.0 to ethanol- preferred peak FEEtOH 38, with an optimal FEEtOHFEethylene ratio of 2.74 Figure S29. From these observations, we experimentally demonstrate that COPCOOH not only contrib- utes to CO2 activation but also plays a crucial role in optimizing key elementary steps associated with ethanol generation in the CO2RR. The long-lasting performance of the CuCOPCOOH catalyst is assessed in a membrane electrode assembly MEA under industrially relevant conditions 100 mA cm2. While the FEEtOH in the MEA catholyte-free operation is lower than in flow cells due to inherent challenges in precisely quantifying liquid products,33,34 the CuCOPCOOH composite maintains stable FEEtOH fluctuating around 30 over 100 h, out- performing Cu NPs, whose FEEtOH attenuates from 8.7 to 3.5 in 40 h Figure 3g. Postanalysis of the spent catalyst reveals minimal aggregation in CuCOPCOOH, whereas severe aggregation occurs in uncoated Cu NPs Figure S30, confirming the COPs role in suppressing electrochemical Ostwald ripening.35 To probe potential degradation of Cu COPCOOH composites, quasi-quantitative SEM-EDS mapping tracked the CCu atomic ratio during electrolysis. As shown in Figure S31, the CCu ratio decreased after 90 h, indicating partial detachment of COPCOOH. This detachment correlates with the observed decline in FEEtOH, underscoring the need for strategies such as periodic COP replenishment or covalent anchoring to enhance interfacial adhesion and extend opera- tional stability. While the above-mentioned CO2-to-ethanol metrics are obtained using pure CO2 feedstocks, this limits practical implementation due to the energy-intensive gas purification. Real-world viability requires CO2RR technologies operating under dilute CO2 streams 1020 vv CO2 from industrial point sources such as coal-fired power plants.36 To bridge this gap, we test the CuCOPCOOH composite under simulated flue gas conditions 20 vv CO2.36 Remarkably, it achieves a high FEEtOH of 40.8 at 1.2 VRHE Figure S32, demonstrating its ability to achieve efficient CO2 conversion under dilute CO2 streams.

XXXX, XXX, XXXXXX F switching to a CO2-saturated environment, this peak shifts positively by 82 mV, accompanied by near-complete suppression of the oxidation peak in COPCOOH Supplemen- tary Note 3. This observation implies the participation of carbonyl motifs in CO2 activation, probably acting as electron mediators to facilitate CO2 activation to CO2 as illustrated in the inset of Figure 4a.19,39 To elucidate the real-time interplay between COP functional motifs and CO2RR intermediates, in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy ATR-SEIRAS is employed. As substantiated by the potential- dependent spectra in Figures 4b,c and S34, COPCOOH exhibits distinct vibrational shifts: OH red-shift from 3238 to 2967 cm1 and CO stretches from 1661 to 1610 cm1. These shifts, absent in COPCO and COPOH, could be rationalized by the intriguing interaction with CO2 as elucidated in the inset of Figure 4a, which elongates CO and OH linkages via charge polarization and hydrogen bonding.19,40 Concurrently, the C O signal for COPCOOH attenuates by 48.2 from 0.8 to 1.6 VRHE Figure 4c, implying the progressive reduction during electrolysis. Moreover, a vibration signal at 1430 cm1, corresponding to the one-electron reduction form of CO2 CO2 , is distinguished across all three COPs. Quantitative spectral analysis reveals that the CO2 signal intensity increases progressively from COPOH to COPCO and COPCOOH Figure 4d, suggesting that the dual functional synergy benefits CO2 activation. After that, we turn to unravel the mechanistic impact of COP functional motifs on steering the CO2RR pathways. We first quantify the CO2",

After that, we turn to unravel the mechanistic impact of COP functional motifs on steering the CO2RR pathways. We first quantify the CO2 adsorption capacities using isothermal titration calorimetry ITC. As shown in Figure S35, the dual- functional CuCOPCOOH exhibits a 6.44-fold higher CO2 adsorption capacity than Cu NPs, following CuCOPCOOH CuCOPCO CuCOPOH. This trend demonstrates that the CO motifs act as molecular antennas to enrich interfacial CO2, and the COOH synergy further amplifies this process. Then, we monitor the real-time evolution of reaction intermediates over CuCOP composites using operando ATR- SEIRAS across 0.8 to 1.6 VRHE Figure 5ad. As a benchmark, almost no discernible signal is observed on the pristine Cu NPs at 0.8 VRHE, consistent with its HER dominance FEH2 40. As the potentials shift cathodic, vibrational signals associated with CObridge 1850 cm1, CHO 1285 cm1, and COCHO 1580 cm1 emerge.41,42 It is worth noting that CuCOPCO and Cu COPCOOH exhibit earlier CO onset and higher intensity than CuCOPOH, directly linking CO motifs to the accelerated CO2 activation.19 CHO signals are also detected and their intensities follow: Cu NPs CuCOPCO Cu COPCOOH CuCOPOH Figure 5e. The higher CHO intensity on CuCOPOH despite its less favorable CHO formation energy Figure 1c arises from slower CHO consumption lack of COCHO signals, Figure 5d.43 Conversely, CuCOPCOOH exhibits efficient CHO depletion via asymmetric coupling as evidenced by the higher COCHO intensity Figure 5b. This trend becomes even more obvious under higher overpotential 1.2 VRHE, aligning with the well- established viewpoint that CC coupling is typically accelerated at higher overpotentials.44 Furthermore, notable COCHO vibration is detected over the CuCOPCOOH composites across the entire potential range, attesting to the heightened asymmetric CC coupling efficiency.45,46 Considering that the asymmetrical CO and CHO coupling is a more energy-efficient pathway for ethanol electrosynthesis, we preliminarily hypothesize that the ethanol selectivity is governed by the dynamic equilibrium of CHO and CO intermediates. To validate this, we derive the potential- dependent CHOCO ratios from operando ATR-SEIRAS Figure S36. For CuCOPCO and CuCOPOH, the CHO CO ratio increases with the applied cathodic bias, reflecting accelerated CO protonation at higher overpotentials. Cu COPOH achieves a higher CHOCO ratio than that of Cu COPCO, directly linking OH motifs to efficient H delivery for CO protonation. In contrast, the CHOCO ratio on Cu COPCOOH declines with the applied potential, signaling rapid CHO depletion, likely due to the promoted CHOCO coupling. These findings establish that COOH synergy balances CHO and CO flux, thereby creating an ideal microenvironment that prioritizes asymmetric CHO-CO coupling to yield ethanol. To delve into the governing principle giving rise to the enhanced ethanol selectivity, we correlate the FEEtOH with the CHOCO ratio derived from three independent operando ATR-SEIRAS measurements Figures 5ad and S37, Table S5. Figure 5f reveals a volcano-shaped dependence, with peak FEEtOH achieved within a moderate CHOCO ratio range 0.230.40, demonstrating",

    "text": "into the governing principle giving rise to the enhanced ethanol selectivity, we correlate the FEEtOH with the CHOCO ratio derived from three independent operando ATR-SEIRAS measurements Figures 5ad and S37, Table S5. Figure 5f reveals a volcano-shaped dependence, with peak FEEtOH achieved within a moderate CHOCO ratio range 0.230.40, demonstrating that balanced CHO and CO coverage maximizes asymmetric CHOCO coupling effi- ciency. To experimentally validate CHOs role, we subject HCHO into the CO2RR system to artificially elevate CHO coverage.47,48 Strikingly, the FEEtOH of CuCOPCOOH is further increased to 59.7 with 0.1 mmol HCHO addition Figure S38, confirming that CHO enrichment drives ethanol formation. These results demonstrate that the CO2 to ethanol selectivity is governed by the dynamic equilibrium between the CO2 to CO conversion mediated by CO motifs and CHO formation accelerated by OH motifs. The synergistic COOH interplay achieves an optimal CHOCO flux, creating an interfacial microenvironment that prioritizes asymmetric CHOCO coupling and preferentially stabilizes the CHCOH intermediate, thereby steering the reaction pathway toward ethanol production. CONCLUSION In summary, we demonstrate that the COOH synergy in the CuCOPCOOH hybrid catalyst unlocks unprecedented efficiency for the electroreduction of CO2 to ethanol. The CO motifs function as a molecular antenna to enrich interfacial CO2 and accelerate its activation, while OH groups facilitate water dissociation to sustain H flux for CO protonation into CHO. This molecular-level synergy dynamically balances CO and CHO coverages, creating an optimal microenvironment for asymmetric CHOCO coupling and preferentially stabilizing the CHCOH intermediate. The CuCOPCOOH composite achieves a remarkable FEEtOH of 54.2 and jEtOH of 121.3 mA cm2 in 0.5 M KHCO3, outperforming state-of-the-art CO2RR electrocatalysts in near-neutral electrolytes. Critically, it retains 40.8 FEEtOH under industrially relevant dilute CO2 feeds 20 vol , showcasing practicality for direct integration with flue gas. By decoupling CO2 activation, proton delivery, and intermediate stabilization through organic motif synergy, this work circumvents the scaling relations that plague conventional CO2RR catalysts. Our findings establish a universal design paradigm for manipulating the CO2RR reaction pathway, offering a roadmap to upgrade waste CO2 streams into carbon-neutral ethanol at scale.

While the oxidation of methylarenes represents an ideal route to aromatic aldehydes due to the availability of starting materials, existing methods face significant challenges, including reliance on hazardous oxidants, costly catalysts, poor scalability, and limited compatibility with electron-deficient substrates. To address these limitations, we report a practical and scalable electrochemical method for the oxidation of electron-deficient methylarenes to access aromatic aldehydes, eliminating the need for chemical oxidants or homogeneous transition-metal catalysts. This approach operates under industrially viable conditionshigh current densities 75 mA cm², minimal electrolyte loading 0.05 equiv, and operation in an undivided cell without additivesto produce aromatic acetals, which are readily hydrolyzed to the corresponding aldehydes. The use of minimal electrolyte not only reduces costs and simplifies product isolation but also significantly enhances anodic oxidation selectivity, ensuring high efficiency and practicality.

Traditional methods for methylarene oxidation rely heavily on stoichiometric oxidants such as chromium, cerium, or hypervalent iodine reagents, raising significant environmental and safety concerns.2-4 Catalytic approaches, while more sustainable, often require expensive metal complexes as catalysts, along with hazardous oxidants like Selectfluor, K₂S₂O₈, or peroxides.5-7 Aerobic oxidation strategies, though promising, are hindered by issues such as overoxidation to carboxylic acids, poor reactivity with electron-deficient substrates, and the complexities of oxygen management at scale.8- 11 Consequently, industry continues to rely on indirect halogenation-oxidationhydrolysis sequences,1, 12-15 which involve hazardous reagents and often yield undesirable mixed halogenation products.14 Electrochemistry has emerged as a sustainable synthetic tool that replaces chemical redox reagents with traceless electrons16-29 and have been applied to the oxygenation of alkylarenes.30-34 Notably, the electrooxidation of electron-rich toluene derivatives has been successfully implemented in the industrial production of p-anisaldehyde and 4-tert-butylbenzaldehyde Fig. 1a.35 However, extending this methodology to electron-deficient methylarenes has proven challenging due to their 10.1002anie.202504612 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

Our method employs industrially relevant conditionshigh current densities 75 mA cm² in undivided cells, minimal electrolyte loading 0.05 equiv, and an additive-free environmentto achieve selective benzylic oxidation without the need for homogeneous metal catalysts or hazardous reagents. The protocol demonstrates broad substrate tolerance, accommodating sterically hindered and poly-substituted methylarenes. Scalability is demonstrated through batch reactions at 100 g and kilogram scales, as well as continuous flow processes. Central to the success of this electrochemical approach is the use of low electrolyte concentrations to enhance the selectivity of anodic oxidation and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol TFE as a solvent, which resists oxidative decomposition and minimizes undesired aromatic ring substitution. The electrochemical oxidation of 2-methylbenzonitrile 1 was selected as a model reaction to establish optimal conditions Fig. 2a. Under industrially relevant current densities 75 mA cm² in an undivided cell, the desired acetal 2 was obtained in 72 yield using trifluoroethanol TFE as the solvent and a minimal electrolyte loading 0.05 equiv of nBu₄NOTf. Subsequent treatment of the post-electrolysis mixture with aqueous HCl furnished benzaldehyde 3 in 67 yield. Notably, the high current density ensures scalability and productivity, while the low electrolyte concentration minimizes costs, simplifies product isolation, and facilitates solvent recyclingcritical advantages for industrial adoption. Counterintuitively, increasing the electrolyte concentration significantly reduced the yield of 2 Fig. 2b. Similarly, elevating the current density to 100 mA cm² marginally decreased the yield 10.1002anie.202504612 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

Among anode materials, platinum outperformed carbon-based electrodes entries 56, which rapidly passivated due to the high oxidation potential of the methylarene 1. Notably, Pt-coated titanium PtTi can be used as a cost-effective alternative vide infra.

Meta- and para-substituted toluenes e.g., 4 11 were successfully oxidized, though nitro-substituted substrates e.g., 12 failed, likely due to competitive cathodic nitro group reduction. Di- and tri-substituted derivatives, including sterically demanding 2,6-dichlorotoluene 29 and highly electron-deficient analogs bearing dual cyano 39 or ester 46 groups, were also viable. Remarkably, substrates with two methyl groups underwent selective mono-oxidation 5254 or, upon application of a higher charge, full oxidation to bisaldehydes 5561, the latter of which remains challenging for conventional methods due to overoxidation. Some substrates, particularly those less electron-deficient than the model nitrile substrate 1, experienced unwanted substitution at the benzene ring. However, these issues were mitigated using nBu4NOTs as the electrolyte. The more basic tosylate likely facilitated benzylic deprotonation, steering the reaction towards benzylic functionalization rather than benzene ring substitution. By contrast, heteroaromatic substrates such as methylated pyridines and pyrimidine did not afford the desired products, indicating a limitation of the current method for electron-deficient heteroarenes see Figure S6 in the Supporting Information for details. Successful scale-up was demonstrated through both batch and continuous flow methodologies. In batch mode, the 100 g-scale oxidation of 62 using PtTi anodes designed to minimize platinum usage afforded aldehyde 36 in 73 isolated yield Fig. 4a, maintaining fidelity with small-scale performance 76 yield, thereby validating process robustness. Notably, direct kilogram-scale electrolysis of 63 under identical conditions delivered aldehyde 11 in 71 yield without requiring parameter reoptimization Fig. 4b, underscoring exceptional translational consistency.

The reaction time for kilogram production could be shortened by increasing the electrode surface area while maintaining a constant current density. For continuous processing, a six-hour operation of compound 64 oxidation was achieved by implementing a modular system of 20 parallel microreactors, producing 34.9 g of aldehyde 14 66 yield, Fig. 4c. This continuous-flow electrochemical reactor configuration, arranged in parallel, was selected to avoid the engineering challenges associated with direct geometric scale-up, such as elevated ohmic resistance and impaired mass and heat transfer, thereby maintaining optimal electrochemical performance and enabling higher efficiency for large- scale electrochemical synthesis. This electrochemical platform eliminates dependence on toxic stoichiometric oxidants e.g., NBS and peroxide and silver-containing reagents mandated by prior protocols,42, 43 while sustaining efficiency across scales. In addition, the TFE solvent used in this process was readily recovered by simple distillation. For the process shown in Fig. 4a, 88 of the TFE was recovered by simple distillation. The electrolysis of compound 1 with recovered TFE afforded compound 2 in 71 yield under standard conditions without any reduction in electrochemical efficiency. 10.1002anie.202504612 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

Reaction monitoring revealed that methylarene 1 first converted to ether intermediate 65, which subsequently transformed into acetal 2 Fig. 5a. At low electrolyte concentrations 0.05 equiv of nBu₄NOTf, 2 accumulated as 1 and 65 were consumed. Conversely, high electrolyte loading 1 equiv led to oxidative decomposition of 2, likely due to reduced selectivity between oxidation of 165 and 2. Cyclic voltammetry suggested that 2 oxidizes at a slightly higher potential than 65 See Supporting the Information for details. Since redox potentials are influenced by electrolyte concentration, this potential gap likely widens under dilute conditions, providing a plausible explanation for the enhanced selectivity observed at lower electrolyte concentrations. 10.1002anie.202504612 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

This stark contrast supports an electron transfer- driven mechanism for the electrochemical process, distinct from the radical-based pathway of thermal bromination. Building on these findings, we propose a stepwise mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation of methylarenes Fig. 5d. Initial single-electron transfer at the anode generates an arene radical cation intermediate I, which undergoes sequential proton and electron transfer to form a benzylic carbocation II. Nucleophilic trapping of II by TFE solvent yields the benzyl ether intermediate III. A subsequent oxidation cycleinvolving analogous electron transfer, protonelectron transfer, and TFE additionconverts III to the final acetal product. Compared to MeOH, TFE is more resistant to oxidative decomposition and less nucleophilic. The use of TFE as the solvent ensures selective oxidation of the electron-deficient methylarene substrates and minimizes unwanted solvent trapping of the arene radical cation intermediates. In summary, we developed a scalable, electrochemical method for oxidizing electron-deficient methylarenes to access benzaldehydes under industrially viable conditions.

Recent breakthroughs in multicomponent molten systems i.e., binary, ternary, and quaternary have shown great potential for effective CH4 pyrolysis at a moderate temperature, opening up exciting possibilities for the industrialization of CH4 pyrolysis. However, the combinatorial complexity of element selection and atomic disorder in molten media, coupled with the limitations of empirical experimentation and conventional computational methods, present great hurdles for multicomponent molten catalysts design. With the development of artificial intelligence and data technology, the data-driven strategy offers a promising alternative to the traditional experimenttheory approach. From this perspective, we expound and emphasize the data- driven approach for enhancing molten media catalysts discovery and advancing the industrialization development of CH4 pyrolysis. We discuss the capacity of this approach to explore the design space along with several data-guided strategies tackling the existing challenges associated with molten catalysts design.

FRONTIER OF MOLTEN CATALYSTS CH4 PYROLYSIS Natural gas, one of the primary global fossil fuel reserves, is abundant and widely employed, playing a significant role in global energy production.1 However, while its direct combus- tion generates vast amounts of energy, this process releases CO2 as a byproduct, contributing negatively to global warming. Thus, a decarbonization of natural gas to hydrogen has always been a pursuit of researchers. As a result, decarbonizing natural gas into hydrogen has long been a focus of scientific research. As an effective pathway of hydrogen H2 production, CH4 pyrolysis can achieve carbon-free clean energy conversion specifically occurring under the temperature, pressure, and catalyst. In the absence of catalysis, full CH4 conversion or dissociation usually requires a high operating temperature or narrow pressure range. Additionally, the reaction mechanism exhibits intricate coupling steps with various branching byproducts that become progressively more complex as the reaction progresses.24 The formation of H2 and carbon is favored at a high reaction temperature e.g., 1200 C, a long residence time for CH4 in the high-temperature reaction zone, and a moderate pressure.5 Catalysts can significantly lower the temperature required for CH4 pyrolysis down to 500800 C in traditional solid catalysts application,6 but in which carbon produced from CH4 pyrolysis often quickly encapsulates solid particles and deactivates catalysts Figure 1A. Among various routes of CH4 conversion i.e., high-temperature thermal cracking,7 catalytic cracking,8 and plasma cracking,9 molten cracking has emerged as a promising solution.

MOLTEN CATALYSTS DESIGN DILEMMA FOR CH4 PYROLYSIS Despite the demonstrated capability of molten catalysts in mitigating coke deposition and catalyst deactivation during CH4 pyrolysis, their industrial implementation remains constrained by the high operating temperatures required by the systems currently reported systems. In this context, the primary challenge for the industrialization of CH4 pyrolysis is the development of highly efficient molten catalysts at low temperatures for decreasing heat supply costs. The recent findings on the catalysis of multimetalsnonmetal elements mixing molten media Figure 1A have shown great potential for effective CH4 pyrolysis at a moderate temperature, opening up exciting possibilities for the industrialization of CH4 pyrolysis. Meanwhile, the potential for mixing multiple molten media presents a vast uncharted space beyond the corners of metal nonmetal elemental and chemical compositional diagrams Figure 1C, offering new avenues for the design of high- efficiency catalysts for CH4 cracking. Previous reports on catalyst compositions, particularly molten metal alloys, have shown that they can be highly effective catalysts and heat-transfer media for CH4 pyrolysis. For instance, in 2017, Upham et al. reported that a 27 Ni73 Bi molten alloy achieved 95 CH4 conversion at 1065 C.13 On the basis of this binary alloy, Chen et al. further proposed a high-efficiency ternary molten metal alloy 2.3 Ni 96.4 Bi1.3 Mo, reaching a hydrogen production efficiency of 4.05 mLgmin even at a low temperature of 800 C.14 Although the inclusion of additional elements offers huge opportunities to design catalysts of molten metals, it also introduces significant challenges in experiments and theory. The first one is the difficulty in exploring the effective alloy, mainly due to the large number of metal elements, the complexity of metal alloy combinations, and the diversity of alloy composition proportion. Even if considering only the most used metal elements in the periodic table, this spans a composition space of at least 1050 metal alloy variants, which cannot be managed by experiment by blind trial and error testing due to the high labor-intensiveness and",

Even if considering only the most used metal elements in the periodic table, this spans a composition space of at least 1050 metal alloy variants, which cannot be managed by experiment by blind trial and error testing due to the high labor-intensiveness and the large energy cost. When the space is expanded to other molten media systems, the challenge is even more hard. Additionally, the experimental understanding of the CH4 activation mechanism in molten catalysts is also challenging owing to the scarcity of in situ tools for molten matter. Second, under an extremely molten liquid state, the catalytic activity geometry, active site, and atomic arrangement of molten media catalysts are dynamically evolving, so that the catalytic activity and reaction mechanism in a liquid catalyst cannot be expounded by conventional catalysis theory.15 In catalysis theory, theoretical reactivity markers are routinely estimated for catalytic property and used in the design of a catalyst. While many theoretical works can be found on solid- state catalysts for various applications,1618 research on molten liquid-state media is still in its nascent stages. In a conventional first-principles simulation, although adopted ab initio molecular dynamics AIMD can obtain an amorphous molten state,19,20 this procedure exhibits a great efficiency bottleneck since it is limited by the need for extensive and costly computational validation. It requires the exploration of a thermodynamic equilibrium model under consideration of a large-atomic scale supercell. In a large spanning space of multimetalsnonmetal elements mixing molten media, the limited spatial and temporal simulation scales of first-principles methods pose challenges in the simulation of dynamic evolution and catalytic CH4 processes in molten catalysts design.

THE ROLE OF MOLTEN MEDIA COMPOSITION FOR CH4 PYROLYSIS CH4 pyrolysis is conceptualized as a complex four-step dehydrogenation process, which is an endothermic, thermody- namically constrained, and equilibrium-limited reaction. In a liquid reaction environment, the composition of molten media affects not only the conversion efficiency of CH4 pyrolysis but also the pyrolysis byproduct type. For industrial viability, the production of high-value carbon is also an important concern, being secondary to catalyst efficiency. In a molten catalytic CH4 pyrolysis, the type of carbon byproduct significantly differs from noncatalytic pyrolysis in a gas condition.4,2124 For example, Palmer et al. reported that the gas CH4 decomposition inside gas bubbles results in amorphous carbon materials,22 while",

In a molten catalytic CH4 pyrolysis, the type of carbon byproduct significantly differs from noncatalytic pyrolysis in a gas condition.4,2124 For example, Palmer et al. reported that the gas CH4 decomposition inside gas bubbles results in amorphous carbon materials,22 while surface decomposition at gasmolten metal interfaces results in the formation of graphitic carbon. By adjusting the composition of molten media, CH4 pyrolysis can not only yield these common carbon forms but also facilitate the production of high-value carbon materials, such as graphene and diamond. For example, by adopting molten copper as the medium, we achieved high- quality multilayer a few layers 40 layers graphene preparation via molten Cu-assisted pyrolysis of methane.11 Recently, our group adopted the ionic complexes of the transition metal chloride and realized the efficient pyrolysis of CH4 and achieved one-pot synthesis of 0D carbon black2D graphene carbon materials.23 Ruoff et al.12 reported that diamond can grow in the subsurface of a molten medium composed of gallium, iron, nickel, and silicon at a 1 atm pressure and 1025 C. These works demonstrated that the different molten media dictated distinct carbon atom growth modes, further determining the carbon product structure. Of course, there also exist some other factors i.e., gas bubble diameter profiles, gas bubble rise velocity, reaction rates, temperature, pressure, and gas compositions that influence carbon formation and its structure. However, from the catalytic viewpoint and structureactivity relationship, the composition of molten media can be considered as a key factor in controlling carbon products, thus necessitating the careful selection for desired outcomes. 4. DATA-DRIVEN STRATEGIES OF MOLTEN CATALYSTS DESIGN FOR CH4 PYROLYSIS Along with the development of artificial intelligence AI and data technologies, the data-driven approaches offer a promising alternative to the traditional experimenttheory approach, which can achieve a much more accurate design or prediction for a large amount of component Figure 1D. In the past decade, machine learning ML and its subdomain deep learning have been explosively rising, which can establish mathematical models to analyze data and reveal the relationships and patterns within them, exhibiting great capability in the field of catalyst design26,27 and alloy predictions, especially in the field of high-entropy alloys.28,29 The success of ML mainly lies in its capability to describe complex patterns within multidimensional data sets, offering systematic optimization pathways through iterative learning processes. ML models enable swift identi- fication of the most promising candidates from thousands of potential catalysts, a feat nearly impossible with traditional methods. For molten catalyst systems, specifically, the challenge of navigating vast compositional spaces makes data-driven strategies particularly valuable. These approaches can efficiently map the complex relationships among composition, structure, and catalytic activity while accounting for the unique physics of liquid-state catalysis.

Descriptor-Guided Design. Data-driven approaches contribute to uncovering catalyst design rules that go beyond physical and chemical intuition. At the heart of this advancement lies the descriptor-guided design methodology, which system- atically leverages structureproperty relationships to identify promising catalyst candidates. As illustrated in Figure 2A, this approach enables the rational design of high-performance systems through carefully selected descriptors that capture essential material characteristics.30 The key point of this approach applied to the molten media design for CH4 pyrolysis is to explore the compositioncatalytic relationship, which can be derived from combining experimental data and theoretical calculations. The theoretical simulations mainly based on first-principles calculations that incorporate simplified model systems can capture the critical aspects of complex realistic systems and thus guide the rational design. Currently, a rough first-principles calculation route Figure 2B can be summarized as follows: obtaining an amorphous molten surface by AIMD, adsorbing the reactants, and calculating the activation barrier using kinetics computation methods e.g., the DFT-based nudged-elastic band method.20 According to the existing molten media prototypes and element-related variations, previous experimenttheoretical simulations-based efforts to elucidate CH4 activation mecha- nisms reveal that a charge transfer at the active site influences the CH4 activation energy, showing solute atoms with less negative charge in molten metal alloy systems exhibit higher activity in CH4 decomposition.13 This chargeactivity correlation offers a suitable option for descriptor-guided design. Based on this essential charge descriptor, Kwon et al. designed Zn0.45Bi0.55 molten alloys as a promising catalyst for CH4 pyrolysis, in which the active metal Zn contributes to changing the charge states of base metal Bi, facilitating CH dissociation.31 Some similar designs were made for CuBi20 and Se-doped NiBi32 molten alloys and their change in the Bader charge of the solvent metal Bi obeys such a rule. Recently, we have explored the Bibased binary molten alloy systems to identify two novel descriptors linked to CH4 activation characteristics: i the H binding energy",

Recently, we have explored the Bibased binary molten alloy systems to identify two novel descriptors linked to CH4 activation characteristics: i the H binding energy of the solute metal as an indicator of CH3H affinity; ii the solute diffusivity as a measure of active-site accessibility.33 Based on these descriptors guidance, we further designed two ternary alloys Bi68Ni27Cu5 and Bi68Ni27Mn5 that demonstrated superior performance with more catalytic activity than the binary BiNi alloy, and their superiority was corroborated by the results of experiments.33 However, current theoretical andor experimental descriptors face important limitations. They often fail to fully capture crucial dynamic phenomena such as the motion of the metal atoms and the vibration of the molecules. At high temperatures, atom or molecule vibrational modes of CH4 pyrolysis often become anharmonic, which could affect the accuracy of free energy calculations, including entropic and enthalpic components; thus, there would be need to consider such effects in the DFT calculations. Additionally, high-temperature molten catalysts may exhibit a mixed electronion conductor effect. However, these effects cannot be accurately accounted for in the static DFT modeling. For complex molten systems, the traditional AIMDDFT calculation route seems to be more difficult for obtaining the rationality of amorphous surfaces generated by AIMD with no scientifically robust structural sampling methods or evaluation criteria. Furthermore, the reaction of CH4 activation possibly occurs at various catalytic environments i.e., the mobile bubble interface; the catalytic activity could be affected by multiple interconnected properties such as surface composition, surface energy, surface tension, viscosity, and density. For instance, Scheiblehner et al. reported Ni-promoted molten metal catalysts exampled by Ni-doped NiSn alloys for methane pyrolysis, for which the reason is attributed to its low surface tension and viscosity, which facilitate the formation of smaller bubbles, thereby increasing the gas residence time within the melt.34 This multifaceted nature of molten catalysis for CH4 pyrolysis calls for the development of more comprehensive descriptors capable of capturing the full complexity of multicomponent catalyst systems. The challenge lies in the extensive computational and experimental resources required to explore the vase compositional space of molten catalysts. Traditional approaches relying solely on experimental methods or computationally intensive AIMDDFT calculations become prohibitively expensive and time-consuming when applied to the full range of potential catalyst compositions. These limitations underscore the need for more efficient strategies in descriptor identification and validation. The establishment of descriptor-guided design principles is fundamentally dependent on comprehensive composition- property data sets. ML enables systematic derivation of mathematical relationships within these data sets, facilitating the identification of latent physicochemical descriptors. This methodology begins with the construction of advanced regression or classification models that quantitatively rank catalyst candidates through statistical correlation analyses between identified descriptors and target performance metrics e.g., CH4 conversion efficiency and activation energy minimization. The analysis then progresses to a rigorous prioritization phase, where candidate materials aligned with strongly correlated descriptor-property relationships. This evaluation",

The analysis then progresses to a rigorous prioritization phase, where candidate materials aligned with strongly correlated descriptor-property relationships. This evaluation applies strict statistical criteria, such as maintaining the Pearson correlation coefficient above 0.7 or meeting comparable significance thresholds. To address the common challenge of data scarcity, the methodology incorporates feature engineering strategies. Through iterative multicycle learning with diversified descriptor combinations, the approach progressively distills critical structureproperty determinants. Such a multiparametric optimization framework effectively overcomes the information extraction limitations inherent to sparse experimental data, thereby enabling data-driven discovery of molten salt catalysts for CH4 pyrolysis. Symbolic regression techniques, particularly the sure independence screening and sparsifying operator SISSO methodology,3537 have emerged as powerful tools for establishing structureactivity relationships in catalysis. These data-driven approaches systematically explore nonlinear corre- lations by constructing mathematical descriptors through combinatorial operations on primary feature sets. As demon- strated in a representative study by Andersen et al.,36 SISSO successfully identified a nonlinear descriptor for single-atom catalysts that surpassed traditional scaling relations in predicting adsorption energies, achieving both improved accuracy and enhanced transferability across material systems. The core strength of symbolic regression lies in its ability to perform exhaustive searches through high-dimensional feature spaces generated by mathematical operator combinations, typically implemented via genetic programming or deterministic optimization algorithms. However, two critical challenges ACS Catalysis pubs.acs.orgacscatalysis Perspective https:doi.org10.1021acscatal.5c02415 ACS Catal. 2025, 15, 1100311012 11006 hinder the direct application of these techniques to the molten catalyst design for CH4 pyrolysis. First, the inherent complexity of molten liquid systems introduces additional degrees of freedom in feature selection, particularly regarding dynamic surface reconstruction and transient coordination environ- ments. Second, while symbolic regression excels at identifying optimal feature combinations, the resulting mathematical expressions often lack physical interpretability, a crucial requirement for guiding rational catalyst design. This interpret- ability gap becomes particularly pronounced when dealing with molten catalysts, where the liquid-phase nature introduces nontrivial thermodynamic and kinetic couplings. To address these limitations, we advise a synergistic approach combining sensitivity analysis with domain-specific feature engineering. Systematic sensitivity mapping of regression- derived descriptors can reveal dominant molten system characteristics such as ionic polarizability and metalligand bond fluctuation frequencies. This physical grounding enables the translation of mathematical descriptors into actionable design principles, such as optimizing charge transfer dynamics or tuning liquid-phase coordination symmetry, thereby establish- ing a closed-loop framework for the development of high- performance molten catalysts. 4.2. Generative Model-Guided Design. Considering some existing data sets of available molten media for CH4 pyrolysis, a realistic expectation is to directly sample new compositions with the desired properties. The generative model offered the potential to explore the unknown combination space. This model learns the intrinsic features of existing data set, acquires knowledge related to element combination, and then samples and generates new components based on the learned patterns. Currently, several techniques i.e., generative adversa- rial network GAN,38 transformers,39 variational autoen- coders,40",

Currently, several techniques i.e., generative adversa- rial network GAN,38 transformers,39 variational autoen- coders,40 and diffusion models41 have been developed to construct generative models. These generative models have been used to instruct multiple materials design research, such as spintronic materials,42 2D materials,43 and high-entropy alloys.44 In general, the generative models require a material encoding method that is compliant with symmetry operations, in which the lattice vectors, elemental species, atomic numbers, and atomic site coordinates are mainly implemented.45,46 However, molten systems present a unique challenge due to their lack of crystalline symmetry, necessitating specialized approaches focused primarily on elemental species generation. Although the reduced complexity of modeling amorphous molten systems is compared to crystalline materials, ensuring the generated materials from a learned distribution fall inside the desired criteria becomes difficult. Thus, the generative framework must be enhanced with additional constraints and fine-tuning mechanisms, specifically tailored to molten catalyst systems. These refinements should incorporate both theoretical understanding of catalytic mech- anisms and experimental insights into structureproperty relationships, ultimately enabling more precise control over the generated catalyst compositions. To illustrate the generative model procedure for generating molten media, a GAN-based simplified flow diagram is illustrated in Figure 2C, in which the generator takes media compositions from the existing experimental and computational data sets as the input and learns their intrinsic features to generate new compositions. The next step then functions as a discriminator for obtaining reasonable compositions. A crucial intermediate step in this process involves systematic element screening through an iterative enumeration method Figure 2D. This process employs multiple physical and chemical criteria to refine the candidate pool. The selection criteria may include fundamental properties such as suitable melting point and boiling point to ensure operational stability, mutual solubility between elements to maintain homogeneous mixing, and strategic difference in electronegativity to promote effective charge transfer between atoms. These filters can reduce the component space of possible molten catalysts and support a high-efficiency learning in the following discriminator step. The primary technical challenge lies in developing a generative model with strong generalization abilities to effectively expedite the discovery of a new molten catalyst system for CH4 pyrolysis. These models must demonstrate sufficient predictive power to justify their computational overheads, ensuring that the efficiency gains from model predictions outweigh the training costs. A well-trained model should capture the training data sets important latent variables and external conditions, serving as a powerful tool for data augmentation. But the current training set cant perform reaction conditions such as temperature and pressure, hindering the generation of ideal model under reaction conditions. To address these limitations, we suggest advancing the field through external-variate training technology and adaptive strategies.

Active Learning-Guided Design. The development of accurate composition-property predictions for CH4 pyrolysis in molten media faces significant challenges due to the limited available data and inherent biases in feature selection. Conven- tional ML approaches often struggle with these constraints, necessitating more sophisticated methodological frameworks. By synthesizing new data points and refining feature selection methods, we can enhance predictive accuracy and reliability. Advanced methodologies, such as active learning, can extract complex patterns from limited data sets, improving our understanding of catalytic methane properties in pyrolysis processes. Active learning has recently emerged as an alternative choice for materials discovery, demonstrating remarkable success across diverse applications.4749 This methodology excels at extracting complex patterns from limited data sets, offering crucial insights into catalytic behavior during pyrolysis processes. For instance, Raabe et al. constructed an active learning strategy to accelerate the design of high-entropy Invar alloys in a practically infinite compositional space based on very sparse data, characterizing 17 new alloys out of millions of possible compositions.48 Similarly, Tran and Ulissi conducted an active learning-guided theoretically automated screening in the huge search space, and proposed 54 alloys and 102 alloys as potential electrocatalysts of CO2 reduction and H2 evolution, respectively.49 These advancements in active learning highlight its potential for revolutionizing material discovery. By employ- ing such an active learning strategy, researchers could efficiently explore vast compositional spaces, identifying promising candidates with minimal prior data in catalytic CH4 pyrolysis. Active learning, constituting a subfield of ML, employs iterative sampling of the design space to enhance model predictions. This approach addresses the inherent limitations of ACS Catalysis pubs.acs.orgacscatalysis Perspective https:doi.org10.1021acscatal.5c02415 ACS Catal. 2025, 15, 1100311012 11007 initial models that inadequately characterize the entire material space while exhibiting significant potential for efficiently navigating vast and complex material systems to discover innovative candidates. A representative active learning frame- work typically integrates Bayesian optimization with surrogate modeling, wherein the model is initially trained on sparse experimental data sets. The surrogate model undergoes iterative refinement through cyclic integration of DFT calculations, thermodynamic simulations, and targeted experimental vali- dation. This creates a dynamic, closed-loop optimization process that progressively improves both prediction accuracy and the models ability to generalize to unexplored materials. Crucially, the methodology achieves an optimal balance between the exploration of uncharted regions and the exploitation of known high-performance areas within the search space.

This dual-focused approach proves to be particularly valuable when addressing the critical challenge of reconciling limited experimental data with high-dimensional search domains. These distinctive advantages position active learning as a particularly promising paradigm for accelerating the discovery of molten catalysts for CH4 pyrolysis in ultralarge parameter spaces. As illustrated in Figure 3, adopting an active learning approach, a closed-loop strategy was given for CH4 pyrolysis molten catalyst design, which includes four interconnected steps: database construction, targeted composition generation, physics-informed screening, and experimental verification. The first step involved collecting all data of molten catalysts verified by experiment, performing a statistical data analysis on these data, and removing a portion of them corresponding to the inefficient composition, in order to obtain a preliminary database. This initial database incorporates detailed feature vectors containing both elemental properties i.e., position in the periodic table, electronegativity, valence electron concen- trations, melting and liquids temperatures, heat capacity, atomic radii and volumes, thermal conductivity and diffusivity, heat of fusion and experimental performance metrics i.e., conversion efficiency, activation energy, along with atomic molten information. The second step involves using generative modeling to explore the unknown composition design space by feature engineering of the existing database. It contains two key constituents, encoder and decoder, in which the encoder learns features from the database as the input and the decoder then functions for producing reasonable media compositions given the learned latent representations. This enables the targeted generation of promising new catalyst compositions. Following generation, a two-stage ensemble regression model further investigated the activity of the generated compositions. The initial stage concerns composition-based regression models aiming at fast and large-scale composition inference, while the second stage conducts physics-based quantitiesmetrics vali- dation such as H formation energy, solute metal diffusivity, surface exposure of active metals, surface tension, and so on through AIMDDFT calculations, ensuring theoretical sound- ness of predictions. In the last step, the most promising compositions are selected by a ranking-based policy. The top- ranked candidates underwent thorough experimental testing. Note that, at high temperatures, gas-phase decomposition of CH4 may also become dominant; thus, we suggest a dual-track experimental workflow to isolate molten media-specific catalytic effects from background CH4 gas-phase pyrolysis: i conduct- ing identical pyrolysis experiments in inert reactors without molten media and systematically mapping temperature-depend- ent methane conversion rates under identical flowpressure conditions; ii performing parallel experiments with molten media under identical conditions and identifying the true catalytic data by subtracting the thermal background. The obtained data and results feed back into the database, continuously enriching the database for subsequent iterations. As the iteration repeats and the experimental database continues Figure 3.

This iterative process not only refines the compositions of molten catalysts but also enhances our understanding of their properties and behaviors. The power of this approach lies in its integration of advanced ML techniques with rigorous computational modeling and experimental validation. This synergistic combination enables the efficient exploration of vast compositional spaces while maintaining scientific rigor. The resulting active learning paradigm accelerates catalyst discovery while advancing our fundamental understanding of sustainable energy conversion processes. 5. TOWARD THE INDUSTRIALIZATION OF DATA-DRIVEN CH4 PYROLYSIS The current data-driven approach for molten catalysts in CH4 pyrolysis research primarily stems from the potential to accelerate the discovery and development of multicomponent molten alloy catalysts. This vision can be operationalized through AI-enabled tools and algorithms designed to assist researchers in identifying optimized catalyst compositions and stoichiometric ratios worthy of experimental validation. Under this way, the integrated application of descriptor-based analysis, generative model recognition, and active learning method- ologies aims to recommend high-performance component combinations that transcend chemical intuition or intelligently explore the vast compositional space within alloy systems to guide experimental investigations. It must be emphasized that the prescriptive analytics achieved through the synergy of catalytic data, machine intelligence, and expert knowledge constitute an iterative process that may not yield immediate results. In this data-driven methodology, a forward model is trained on an initial small data set, which feeds to an optimizer to generate experimental recommendations. A set of these recommendations are experimentally validated, and the data generated are used to expand the data set for model retraining, in order to enhance the predictive accuracy of target variables and enable more confident proposals for subsequent experimental iterations. By these steps and more iterations, we can be confident that the catalyst to meet the needs of methane pyrolysis industrialization will be obtained. It should be believed that the data-driven methodology will revolutionize the catalysts research paradigm of CH4 pyrolysis, accelerating the industri- alization of CH4 pyrolysis Figure 4A. Looking ahead, we anticipate that data-driven tools will be deeply integrated into the entire workflow of CH4 pyrolysis catalysis research, accelerating experimental design, empower- ing data analytics, and fostering the emergence of multi- component molten catalysts. This integration will drive data- informed rational design of molten catalysts and provide innovative solutions to address the grand scientific challenge of developing highly efficient, low-consumption catalysts tailored for the industrialization of CH4 pyrolysis. 6.

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK This perspective offers an in-depth exploration of the potential of a data-driven strategy in the development of high-perform- ance molten catalysts for CH4 pyrolysis, highlighting their pivotal role in accelerating the industrialization of this process. The data-driven strategies are becoming increasingly important in the pursuit of efficient molten catalysts, offering a promising path in CH4 pyrolysis research. By leveraging data sets and ML techniques, researchers can use effective descriptors derived from the composition-property relationship, extrapolative sampling, and generating candidate materials in the latent space based on generative models. Additionally, active learning can be used to expand training sets, enabling exploration of the vast combinatorial space of potential elements and combina- tions. This approach significantly reduces both time and costs associated with traditional experimental or computational methods. This strategy enables a more systematic identification of optimal catalyst compositions that deliver high activity and catalytic efficiency for CH4 pyrolysis while minimizing energy inputs.

The question of whether these data-driven emerging methodologies, in conjunction with current market demands, will revolutionize the landscape of CH4 pyrolysis research remains an intriguing topic awaiting further exploration. Some outlooks are given as follows: i. Developing ML-Based Molten Catalyst ModelingThis model involves constructing a high-quality training data set that includes molten media data related to possible element-component-pyrolysis methane activity. This task necessitates integrating diverse sources of data, encom- passing experimental data including reaction conditions i.e., high-temperature and high-pressure and reactor parameters, computational data, theoretical models, and domain expertise, to train models capable of capturing the intricate relationships between composition and catalytic property of molten media. The data must be collected and managed efficiently for the use in model training. The language models LLMs such as GPT,55 DeepSeek56 hold promise for playing a pivotal role in accelerating data acquisition. Their advanced natural language processing and text mining capabilities facilitate efficient navigation and extraction of relevant information from scientific literature. To ensure the reliability of data from LLMs, we can implement consensus-based verification workflows where multiple LLMs independently process the same data sources. Discrepancies between outputs will automatically trigger human expert review, creating a safety net for critical parameters.

Developing Self-Driven Platform for Data Acquisition In addition to data availability concerns, more exper- imental validation of ML tasks would help establish the utility of these approaches in a molten environment as well as provide insight into the performance of the model. This reality can be accelerated through the utility of some schemes i.e., widespread experimental researcher partic- ipation in scientific data commons initiatives, developing auto high-throughput experiments, standardization of the characterization of relevant properties data. Through an automation of experimental workflows and autonomous data-driven planning agents system, a self-data-driven platform can be enabled for catalyst design and CH4 pyrolysis testing Figure 4B, in which the extending accumulation of experimental data would facilitate the data learning optimization and comprehensively enhance the overall efficiency of data-driven CH4 pyrolysis catalysis research, significantly accelerating research progress. iii. Advancing Multiscale and ML Force Field Approaches for Molten SimulationsAnother important challenge is related to the realistic molten simulation of CH4 pyrolysis. Although the first-principles calculation method men- tioned above can roughly simulate the microscopic process of CH4 pyrolysis, the nonintrinsic risk of its obtained data needs to update current approaches and develop new route to push the boundaries of simulating down further to real reaction. At high temperatures, molecule or atom vibrational modes of CH4 pyrolysis often become anharmonic. To consider such effects in the accounted DFT simulation, a promising approach is to develop temperature-dependent effective potential to systematically capture anharmonic contributions by iteratively refining interatomic force constants from AIMD trajectories. Along this direction, further efforts are required to develop multiscale calculation methods for simulating the realistic molten catalysis data. In particular, the development and application of an ML force field MLFF, also called the ML potential, MLP would be essential in providing a long time scale and large atomistic scale simulations at a near-DFT level. The development of general-purpose interatomic potentials is one of the most promising applications of ML to research. However, though there are some typical works that report the precise development of carboncatalyst interactions,58 the applications of MLFF for molten catalysis CH4 pyrolysis remain rare. We anticipate that such MLFF will be used to simulate the realistic CH4 pyrolysis systems and, eventually, to accelerate the development of multicomponent molten catalysts design technologies. iv.

Spinel cobalt oxides Co3O4 are promising NO3RR electrocatalysts, yet the exact NO hydrogenation mechanism remains unclear. Here, we integrate theoretical calculations and systematic experiments to reveal that the hydrogenation pathway is dictated by the coordination environment, which can be tuned via crystal facet engineering. Co3O4 nanoparticles enriched with 111 facets o-Co3O4 and 100 facets c-Co3O4 were synthesized to expose 4- and 6-coordinated Co sites, respectively. Theoretical results show that o-Co3O4 favors nitrogen-site hydrogenation NO NHO, while c-Co3O4 promotes oxygen-site hydrogenation NO NHO, leading to distinct rate-determining steps. This selectivity is experimentally supported by in situ spectroscopy, which detects the NH2OH intermediate exclusively on o-Co3O4. Consequently, o-Co3O4 achieves superior NO3RR performance, with a Faradaic efﬁciency of 99.4 and an NH3 yield rate of 12.8 mg h1 cm2 at 0.4 V. This work uncovers the coordination-governed mechanism of NO hydrogenation and establishes facet engineering as an effective strategy for directing reaction pathways in NO3RR. Introduction Nitrate NO3 is a major nitrogen pollutant in groundwater, rivers, and lakes, posing signiﬁcant risks to ecosystems by disrupting the natural nitrogen cycle.13 In parallel, Dr. S. Niu, Y.

This selective hydrogenation step is also central to emerging strategies for electrochemical co-reduction of NO3and CO2, where NH2OH can react with CO2-derived intermediates to produce alkylamines e.g., methylamine, a valuable feed- stock in the chemical industry. Despite signiﬁcant progress in NO3RR catalysts, the NO hydrogenation mechanism remains underexplored, with conﬂicting hypotheses about whether nitrogen or oxygen atoms serve as the primary hydrogenation site.1625 Cobalt-based materials have emerged as promising NO3RR electrocatalysts due to their high catalytic activity, ease of synthesis, and low cost compared to noble metals. Previous Co-based NO3RR studies have mainly focused on optimizing adsorption sites for NO3and NOx inter- mediates, enhancing NOx hydrogenation, and leveraging Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2025, e202508227 1 of 9 2025 Wiley-VCH GmbH Research Article cooperative effects between active sites to improve ammonia yield while suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction.23,2630 However, the speciﬁc hydrogenation mechanism of NO on Co-based catalysts remains largely unexplored. Both nitrogen-site NH and oxygen-site OH hydrogenation pathways are thermodynamically feasible and can lead to ammonia formation. To advance NO3RR catalyst design and optimize selectivity for NH3 and NH2OH, it is essential to systematically investigate the relative contributions of these competing hydrogenation pathways. In this work, we use spinel Co3O4 as a model electro- catalyst to investigate the selective hydrogenation site of the NO intermediate during NO3RR. Theoretical calculations ﬁrst identify the adsorption behavior of NO on two distinct crystal facets: 111 and 100. The results reveal that the 111 facet, with 4-coordinated Co sites, favors hydrogenation at the nitrogen site, forming NHO intermediate. In contrast, the 100 facet, with 6-coordinated Co sites, promotes oxygen-site hydrogenation, leading to NOH formation. To validate these ﬁndings, we synthesize Co3O4 nanoparticles with enriched 111 crystal facets noted as o-Co3O4 and 100 crystal facets noted as c-Co3O4 and analyze their reaction intermediates by in-situ Fourier transform infrared FTIR spectroscopy. The distinction in hydrogenation pathways is attributed to the difference in NO adsorption: NO binds in a bridged conﬁguration on 4-coordinated Co sites, whereas on 6- coordinated Co sites, it adopts an on-top adsorption mode. This variation affects electron donation from Co sites to NO, altering the charge density distribution between nitrogen and oxygen, which in turn dictates the preferred hydrogenation pathway. As a result, o-Co3O4 catalyst achieves a high Faradaic efﬁciency FE of 99.4 for NH3 at 0.4 V, with a corresponding NH3 yield rate of 12.8 mg NH3 h1 cm2. This study provides new insights into the role of cobalt coordination in NO hydrogenation, addressing discrepancies in prior research and guiding the design of selective NO3RR electrocatalysis.

This study provides new insights into the role of cobalt coordination in NO hydrogenation, addressing discrepancies in prior research and guiding the design of selective NO3RR electrocatalysis. Results and Discussion To elucidate the key factors underlying distinct hydrogenation pathways, o-Co3O4 and c-Co3O4 were selected as the model systems. As shown in Figure 1a,b, the cobalt coordination environment on the surfaces of o-Co3O4 and c-Co3O4 differs signiﬁcantly and causes distinct NO adsorption behaviors. The o-Co3O4 surface predominantly consists of tetrahedral Co, serving as NO adsorption sites. Upon exposing on the surface, the tetrahedral Co becomes tricoordinated and extruded out, which grants the tetrahedral Co sites mobility. As a result, once the NO approaches the surface, it drives the migration of the tetrahedral Co and forms the bridged adsorption conﬁguration. In contrast, the c-Co3O4 surface contains both tetrahedral and octahedral Co, with the latter primarily being responsible for NO adsorption. However, since the octahedral Co forms bonds with ﬁve lattice oxygens and is embedded in the surface, the NO is adsorbed on this site via an on-top conﬁguration. The distinct NO adsorption behaviors alter the reactivity of N and O toward hydrogen, thus, posing different hydrogenation pathways. As shown in the Figure 1c, the NO NHO pathway is more favorable for the bridged conﬁguration, as it exhibits a lower Gibbs free energy change G value of 0.17 eV, compared to that of 0.55 eV for the NO NHO pathway. However, for the on-top conﬁguration, the G of NO NHO pathway is 0.02 eV, signiﬁcantly lower than the 1.04 eV of the NO NHO pathway. To understand the principle behind the hydrogenation pathway selectivity, we conducted Bader charge analysis on NO of the two adsorption conﬁgurations Figure S1. Figure 1d shows that for the on-top conﬁguration, the NO molecule receives 0.23 electrons from the octahedral Co site, 0.06 electrons on N, and 0.17 electrons on O. In contrast, for the bridged conﬁguration, the two tetrahedral Co sites each provides 0.24 electrons to the NO molecule, which is also evenly distributed on N and O. Since N has a lower electronegativity than O, the excess accumulation of electrons to N on the bridged conﬁguration compared to the on-top one drives the change of hydrogenation site from O to N. The crystal orbital Hamilton populations COHP method was adopted to further clarify the hydrogenation pathway selectivity.31 Figure 1e shows the COHP results for the OH bond of the NOH intermediate and the NH bond of the NHO intermediate. The positive value of COHP indicates the bonding states, and the negative value indicates the anti-bonding states. The highest occupation energy level is indicated by the Fermi level, which is at 0 eV. The rule is that if more anti-bonding states of the bond are occupied, the bond is less stable.32 It is found that all examined bonds have their anti-bonding states being partially occupied,",

The rule is that if more anti-bonding states of the bond are occupied, the bond is less stable.32 It is found that all examined bonds have their anti-bonding states being partially occupied, except for the NH bond on o-NHO, i.e., NHO intermediate on the o-Co3O4 surface. The area for the occupied anti-bonding states was calculated to be 0.047, 0.063, and 0.012 eV for the OH bond on o-NOH, the NH bond on c-NHO, and the OH bond on c-NOH, respectively. Therefore, from the COHP analysis, it is also concluded that NO on the bridged conﬁguration tends to be hydrogenated on the N site, while NO on the on-top conﬁguration tends to be hydrogenated on the O site. These results suggest that the coordination environment of Co sites on Co3O4 surface signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the adsorp- tion conﬁguration of the NO and then the hydrogenation pathways. To experimentally validate the predicted hydrogenation pathways, Co3O4 nanostructures with exposed 100 and 111 facets were prepared by two-step synthesis strategy Figure S2. Speciﬁcally, c-Co3O4 and o-Co3O4 samples were fabricated by ﬁrst adjusting the reactant ratio via a solvothermal method to obtain the precursor, followed by annealing. X-ray diffraction XRD conﬁrmed the phase purity of both c-Co3O4 and o-Co3O4, with diffraction peaks matching the standard Co3O4 reference JCPDS No.742120 at 19.0, 31.3, 36.8, 44.8, 59.3, and 65.2 Figure 2a.

The corresponding fast Fourier transform FFT pattern Figure 2e3 closely matched the simulated diffraction pattern Figure 2e4. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum EDS mapping images Figure 2f and S4ac conﬁrmed a uniform distribution of Co and O elements. Similarly, the 100 facet of c-Co3O4 exhibited the regular arrangements of Co atoms and O atoms Figure 2g and 2h1, which was also in agreement with the simulated structural model Figure 2h2. The FFT pattern for the 100 facet showed strong alignment with the simulated diffraction pattern Figure 2h3, h4. More- over, the EDS mapping further conﬁrmed the homogeneous distribution of Co and O elements in c-Co3O4 Figures 2i and S4df. X-ray photoelectron spectra XPS were conducted to examine the surface valence states of Co and O in c- Co3O4 and o-Co3O4. In the high-resolution Co 2p XPS spectra Figure 3a, the yellow peaks at 779.9 and 795.2 eV correspond to Co 2p32 and Co 2p12 peaks of Co3, respec- tively, while the blue peaks at 781.7 and 797.1 eV are attributed to Co2.26,33 In the O 1s spectrum Figure 3b, the peak at 529.9 eV corresponds to lattice oxygen Olatt from Co3O4, while the peaks at 531.8 and 533.3 eV are assigned to adsorbed hydroxyl groups OH and water H2O, respectively.33,34 The ratio of OOHH2OOlatt in o- Co3O4 was signiﬁcantly higher than in c-Co3O4, indicating a greater surface coverage of adsorbed oxygen species. Therefore, the higher adsorbed oxygen in o-Co3O4 is expected to enhance NO3RR performance. To further analyze the electronic structure and coordination environment, X-ray absorption near-edge structure XANES and extended X- ray absorption ﬁne structure EXAFS spectroscopy were performed. The Co K-edge XANES analysis revealed that the absorption edges of o-Co3O4 and c-Co3O4 are nearly identical, which exhibit similarities to the reference Co3O4 but signiﬁcant differences from the CoO reference and Co foil Figure 3c, indicating that o-Co3O4 and c-Co3O4 have similar electronic structures.34,35 The EXAFS spectra in R- space revealed that both samples exhibited vibration patterns similar to the Co3O4 reference Figure 3d, with main peaks at 1.2 and 2.4 Å corresponding to CoO and CoCo Angew.

The NO3RR performance of the as-prepared catalyst was evaluated in a conventional H-type electrolytic cell using a three-electrode conﬁguration under ambient conditions. As shown in Figure 4a, the linear sweep voltammetry LSV was performed in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with and without 0.1 M KNO3 at a scan rate of 5 mV s1 without iR-compensation. The current density increased signiﬁcantly with the addition of 0.1 M KNO3, conﬁrming the occurrence of NO3RR. Notably, o-Co3O4 exhibited a higher current density than c- Co3O4 across all tested potentials. The standard curve for quantifying NH3 concentration, obtained using colorimetric methods, is presented in Figure S5. Chronoamperometry tests were conducted for 1 h in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with 0.1 M KNO3, with potentials ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 V versus RHE Figure S6.

Additionally, the FE of NO3RR byproducts NO2 remains below 1.0 for both catalysts across all tested potentials Figure S7.

The NH3 yield and FE obtained from 1H nuclear magnetic resonance NMR spectroscopy closely matched those measured by UVvis spectroscopy, verifying quantiﬁcation accuracy Figure 4f.48 To investigate the factors contributing to the superior activity of o-Co3O4, the electrochemical surface area ECSA was assessed by measuring double-layer capacitance Cdl, which correlates with active site density Figure S9. The similar ECSA values of o-Co3O4 and c-Co3O4 indicate comparable numbers of active sites. The catalytic activity nor- malized by ECSA demonstrates a signiﬁcantly higher intrinsic activity for o-Co3O4 compared to c-Co3O4 Figure S10 11. Furthermore, EIS was conducted to examine NO3RR electron transfer kinetics. As shown in Figure S12, two catalysts exhibit a similar solution resistance Rs of about 3.4 , but a signiﬁcantly distinct charge transfer resistance Rct. c-Co3O4 shows lower charge transfer resistances than o-Co3O4 at various potentials, indicating the faster electron transfer kinetics of NO3RR on o-Co3O4. Such difference in reaction kinetics can lead to the divergent ammonia yield rates between two catalysts. Beyond the catalytic activity, durability plays a pivotal role in evaluating the overall catalytic performance. Chronoamperometric measurement at 0.4 V for 30 h reveals no signiﬁcant decrease in current density Figure 4g.

The above experimental result demonstrates that o-Co3O4 has high intrinsic active site and excellent stability. In situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy FTIR tests at different potentials were conducted to monitor the reaction intermediates Figure S15. The peaks at 1685, 1342, 1589, and 1101 cm1 correspond to H2O, NO3, NH4, NO2, and NH2, respectively Figures 5a,b and S16. Notably, the NO2 peak is downward-facing, likely due to the consumption rate of NO2exceeding its production rate.29,4951 Interestingly, the adsorption modes of NO differ between o-Co3O4 and c-Co3O4, with o-Co3O4 exhibiting bridge adsorption 1539 cm1, while c-Co3O4 shows an on-top conﬁguration 1385 cm1.49,52,53 Additionally, the appearance of the NOH 1355 cm1 intermediate on c- Co3O4 indicates that the reaction follows an oxygen-terminal hydrogenation pathway.54,55 The in situ FTIR spectra of o-Co3O4 and c-Co3O4 are similar, but o-Co3O4 exhibits a distinct peak at 1160 cm1, which corresponds to the NH2OH intermediate, absent in c-Co3O4.56,57 Online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry DEMS was then applied to capture the possible intermediates and products. The mz signals of 46, 30, 17, and 16 corresponding to NO2, NO, NH3, and NH2 were recorded for both o-Co3O4 and c-Co3O4 Figure S17. Notably, the NH2OH signal mz of 33 was present on o-Co3O4 but absent on c-Co3O4. NH2OH is the key intermediate that determines whether the reaction pathway is NOH or NHO. This observation suggests that o- Co3O4 follows the NHO pathway while c-Co3O4 undergoes the NOH pathway to produce NH3. Angew. Chem. Int.

The d-band center εd is a key descriptor for evaluating the electrocatalytic activity. As depicted in Figure 5c, εd for o-Co3O4 is 1.249 eV, while for c-Co3O4 is 1.382 eV. The closer proximity of o-Co3O4s εd to the Fermi level EF ensures a more efﬁcient electron transfer process on its surface. Consequently, the adsorption and activation of key intermediates were enhanced during the NO3RR process, ultimately leading to improved catalytic activity of o-Co3O4. It is well established that NO3adsorption plays a critical role in the NO3RR progress. Figure S19 shows that the two O atoms in NO3are adsorbed onto the two Co atoms in both o-Co3O4 and c-Co3O4. The adsorption energy of NO3 is 0.32 eV on o-Co3O4 and 0.11 eV on c-Co3O4. This indicates that o-Co3O4 is thermodynamically more favorable for NO3adsorption, facilitating the easier progression of the NO3RR. Subsequently, the hydrogen evolution reaction HER energy barriers were calculated for both catalysts Figure S20. As shown in Figure 5d, GH values of the two catalysts are similar, with o-Co3O4 performing slightly better. This indicates that o-Co3O4 is less prone to hydrogen evolution and more effective at suppressing side reactions, leading to superior NO3RR activity. As shown in Figure 1c and o-Co3O4 follows the NHO pathway, while c- Co3O4 follows the NOH pathway. The free energy of each intermediate was calculated in Figure 5e. The corresponding intermediate adsorption conﬁgurations are shown in Figure S21 and S22. For o-Co3O4, the energy barrier for NO hydrogenation to form NHO is 0.17 eV, identiﬁed as the rate-determining step RDS. In contrast, for c-Co3O4, the RDS is NOH deoxygenation to form N, with an energy barrier of 0.89 eV, signiﬁcantly higher than that of o-Co3O4. Combined with EIS analysis of charge transfer resistance, the lower energy barrier of the RDS on o-Co3O4 indicates faster reaction kinetics compared to c-Co3O4, leading to their distinct ammonia yield rates despite similar Faradaic efﬁciencies. Except for RDS, all other reaction steps for both catalysts are downhill, promoting the favorable adsorption of intermediates involved in the reaction. Therefore, FTIR and theoretical calculations demonstrated that different reaction pathways of o-Co3O4 and c-Co3O4, with o-Co3O4 exhibiting superior NO3RR activity. Conclusion In summary, we integrated both theoretical calculations and experimental approaches to elucidate how the coordination number CN of Co affects hydrogenation pathways in the NO3RR. We demonstrated that CN of Co can be regulated by changing the crystal facets of Co-based spinel Angew. Chem. Int.

Conversely, the c-Co3O4, with 6-coordinated Co as NO adsorption sites, displays NO NHO hydrogenation pathway. Moreover, the RDS of the NO3RR on o-Co3O4 and c-Co3O4 varied, with o-Co3O4 exhibiting NO NHO and c-Co3O4 following NOH N The NH3 yield rate of o- Co3O4 reached 12.8 mg NH3 h1 cm2 with a FE of 99.4 at 0.4 V, surpassing that of c-Co3O4. This work highlights that the CN of Co affects the hydrogenation pathway, providing insights for the selection of reaction mechanism.

Wu e202508227 Cobalt-Oxygen Coordination Steering NO Hydrogenation in Nitrate Electroreduction The hydrogenation pathway of the NO intermediate is a critical step determining the selectivity of hydroxylamine, yet current understanding remains limited. Studies reveal that the hydrogenation sites of the NO intermediate are governed by the cobalt coordination environment. Speciﬁcally, NO adsorbs in a bridged conﬁguration on 4-coordinate cobalt sites, which facilitates nitrogen-site hydrogenation, whereas it adsorbs in an on-top manner on 6-coordinate cobalt sites, promoting oxygen-site hydrogenation.

Catalyst design remains one pivotal element in addressing this challenge. Here, eﬃcient CuCo dual active sites embedded in hollow cobalt oxide nanoboxes are created for the electrocatalytic low-concentration NO reduction reaction NORR. Cu-modiﬁed cobalt oxide Cu-Co3O4 and its heterophase interface with copper oxide Cu-Co3O4CuO both exhibit over 93 Faraday eﬃciency for NH3 synthesis, with a yield reaching up to 59.10 µg h1 mgcat 1 at 0.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode by utilizing simulated industrial NO exhaust 1 vol as the feedstock, surpassing those of pure cobalt oxide and some reported catalysts. Theoretical calculations and NO temperature- programmed desorption experiments demonstrate that the incorporation of Cu signiﬁcantly enhances NO adsorption and reduces the energy barrier of the rate-determining step. The integration of Cu-Co3O4 and Cu-Co3O4CuO within the cathode of the ZnNO battery demonstrates a notable power density of 2.02 mW cm2, highlighting a propitious direction for investigating highly eﬃcient conversion of low-concentration NO exhaust gas. 1. Introduction The growing importance of health implications, nitrogen cycle disruptions, and environmental issues such as acid rain, pho- tochemical smog, and ozone depletion arising from nitric ox- ide NO emissions in industrial and vehicle exhaust is draw- ing the focus of researchers from diverse ﬁelds.13 Eﬀorts are actively underway to tackle these challenges using a range of D.

Given the signiﬁcantly lower NO concentrations 5 vol derived from industrial emissions and plasma-activated nitrogen, the ex- ploration of low-concentration or industrially simulated NO ex- haust electrocatalytic conversion holds practical importance.31 Although Cu is the most active metal catalyst for NORR at high concentrations, its Faraday eﬃciency is less than 10 at low concentrations.32 This is mainly because the mass transfer and adsorption of NO gas on the catalyst surface becomes diﬃcult Adv.

Subsequently, researchers tried to develop various strategies to design catalysts to address these two chal- lenges, including defect engineering,33 strain engineering,34 and composition regulation. Zhangs group achieved eﬃcient conversion of low-concentration NO by constructing porous car- bon on the surface of Cu nanowire arrays to improve NO diﬀu- sion and coverage.35 Considering that metallic Co and its oxides are the active components for NO conversion and NH3 synthesis, we recently implanted Ru into Co nanoparticles to induce phase transition to enhance NO adsorption capacity, thereby promot- ing NORR activity.36,37 Porous micronanostructures character- ized by intricate hollow conﬁgurations maximize active site ex- posure, thereby amplifying mass diﬀusion and culminating in superior electrocatalytic activity.38 Therefore, the strategic de- sign and synthesis of electrocatalysts with NO adsorption capaci- ties within the active components ensconced in hollow structures represent a pioneering pathway toward a novel paradigm in elec- trocatalytic NORR for ammonia synthesis.

In this work, we report an eﬃcient CuCo dual-site system embedded in hollow cobalt oxide nanoboxes for ammonia syn- thesis through a synergistic approach involving acid etching and cation exchange strategies. Cu-modiﬁed cobalt oxide Cu-Co3O4 and its heterophase interface with copper oxide Cu-Co3O4CuO both exhibit over 93 Faraday eﬃciency for NH3 synthesis, with a yield reaching up to 59.10 μg h1 mgcat 1 at 0.4 V versus re- versible hydrogen electrode vs. RHE at a low NO concentra- tion of 1 vol 1 thereafter, exceeding pure cobalt oxide and some reported catalysts under similar testing conditions. The in- tegrated Zn-NO system demonstrated a power density of 2.02 mW cm2 and an NH3 yield of 17.66 μg h1 mgcat 1. Theoret- ical calculation results prove that Cu modiﬁcation signiﬁcantly optimizes the electronic structure of the catalyst and lowers the energy barrier of the rate-determining step. These ﬁndings oﬀer novel insights into the design of catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of low-concentration NO. 2.

Finally, by varying the content of the metal Cu and calcin- ing in air, we obtained pure cobalt oxide Co3O4 and a series of cobalt oxides embedded with CuCo bimetallic sites sam- ples obtained at a Cu salt concentration of 0.625 mM were de- noted as Cu-Co3O4. As the concentration of the metal salt in- creased, the material transitioned into a heterogeneous structure comprising Cu-Co3O4 and CuO samples obtained at a Cu salt concentration of 2.5 mM were labeled as Cu-Co3O4CuO. The two experimental conditions actually represent the same cation exchange approach, with the only variation being the concentra- tion of Cu metal salt 0.625 mM for Cu-Co3O4 and 2.5 mM for Cu-Co3O4CuO. The subsequent calcination was applied to all samples as the ﬁnal step. Therefore, the only variable across sam- ples was the Cu loading amount, with low concentrations pro- ducing Cu-doped Co3O4 phases and high concentrations yield- ing Cu-Co3O4CuO heterostructures. The results indicated that the hollow structure of Co3O4 was well maintained without ob- vious aggregation and collapse, as evidenced from an open NB Figure 2a; Figure S6a,b, Supporting Information. TEM images further demonstrated the hollow structure with a wall thickness of 20 nm Figure 2b. Notably, the surface of the nanocubes was assembled from ultraﬁne oxide nanoparticles, establishing a porous network between them that was conducive to promot- ing the exposure of active sites and enhancing substance dif- fusion Figure 2c. After the introduction of Cu elements, the morphology and structure of Cu-Co3O4 were eﬀectively retained Figure 2d,e. High-resolution TEM HRTEM image revealed a lattice spacing of 2.44 Å, corresponding to the 311 crystal plane Figure 2f.

Notably, the lattice spacing of 2.44 and 2.53 Å corresponded to the 311 crystal plane of Cu-Co3O4 and the 002 crystal plane of CuO, respectively. In the SAED pattern, additional diﬀraction information was successively correlated with the 002 and 20-2 crystal plane of CuO from the inner to the outer regions. These results further conﬁrmed the formation of the Cu-Co3O4CuO heterophase structures. Inductively coupled plasma optical emis- sion spectroscopy results indicated that the CuCo atomic ratios in Cu-Co3O4 and Cu-Co3O4CuO were 0.19:1 and 1.47:1, respec- tively, and EDS also conﬁrmed the presence of these elements Table S1; Figure S14, Supporting Information. XRD was utilized to identify the crystalline phase details of the catalysts. At lower Cu implantation levels, the catalyst exhibited a typical spinel oxide structure Figure S15, Supporting Infor- mation. Furthermore, the synchrotron radiation powder XRD with robust signal resolution provided additional validation of these observations Figure S16, Supporting Information.

Compared with Co3O4 NBs, the binding energy of Co 2p in Cu-Co3O4 NBs and Cu-Co3O4CuO NBs negatively shifted by 0.6 eV, indicating electron transfer from Co to Cu atoms upon the introduction of Cu elements.43 Consequently, the integration of Cu into Co3O4 NBs led to a notable cooperative charge eﬀect, modifying their electronic conﬁgurations and possibly boosting electrochemical activity. In the Cu 2p XPS spectra Figure S18b, Supporting Infor- mation, strong satellite peak signals were observed, which were typical characteristics of Cu2. X-ray absorption near-edge structure XANES and X-ray ab- sorption ﬁne structure EXAFS were examined for investigat- ing the coordination environment and electronic structure in- formation of electrocatalysts. Compared with Co3O4 NBs, the absorption edges in the Co K-edge spectra of Cu-Co3O4 NBs and Cu-Co3O4CuO NB shift toward higher energy, indicating an increase in the oxidation state of Co by introducing Cu atoms Figure 3d. The corresponding EXAFS spectra of Co K- edge show that the three catalysts have similar coordination en- vironments, indicating that Cu modiﬁcation does not signiﬁ- cantly alter the coordination of Co atoms Figure 3e. Speciﬁ- cally, the three main peaks in the EXAFS spectrum are attributed to CoO, octahedral CoCo and tetrahedral CoCoCu bonds, respectively.44 In the Cu K-edge XANES spectra Figure 3f, com- pared with the CuO reference, the shoulder peak at 8985 eV of Cu-Co3O4 NBs disappears, and the adsorption edge shifts to higher energy, indicating that Cu implantation results in a dis- tinct state rather than the formation of independent CuO. In Cu-Co3O4CuO NBs, the adsorption edge is only slightly more positive than that of the CuO reference, accompanied by the ap- pearance of a shoulder peak, suggesting the formation of a het- erophase interface. In the corresponding Cu K-edge EXAFS spec- tra Figure 3g, the Cu-Co3O4 NBs sample only exhibits peaks at 1.54 and 2.50 Å, corresponding to CuO and CuCu bonds, re- spectively. The disappearance of the peak at 2.93 Å indicates the diﬀerences in their coordination environments from the CuO ref- erence and the successful insertion of Cu into Co3O4 NBs. How- ever, a small peak emerges at 2.93 Å for Cu-Co3O4CuO NBs, suggesting the formation of CuO. The wavelet transform WT of k3-weighted Co K-edge EXAFS spectra reﬂects information about Co-O and Co-Co bonds that align with the EXAFS spectra Figure 3hj. These results indicate that Cu implantation eﬀec- tively regulates the electronic structure and coordination environ- ment of Co3O4 NBs.

A larger current was observed when 1 NO substrate was introduced into the electrolyte, indicating that electrochemical NORR occurred Figure 4a; S19, Supporting Information. The generated ammo- nia was quantitatively detected by a colorimetric method Figure S20, Supporting Information. Before each potentiostatic test, high-purity He gas was passed through to purify the electrolyte by displacing oxygen. The electrochemical NORR performance of Cu-Co3O4 NBs for ammonia production was evaluated in the range of 0.40.8 V vs. RHE Figure S21, Supporting Informa- tion, and the results showed a Faraday eﬃciency of 94.13 and an NH3 yield of 54.28 μg h1 mgcat 1 Figure 4b. Detection mea- surements revealed no trace of other liquid products, including hydrazine Figures S22 and S23, Supporting Information and hydroxylamine Figures S24 and S25, Supporting Information. To highlight the advantages of the CuCo dual active sites, the NORR performance of pure Co3O4 NBs was also assessed, reveal- ing a lower Faraday eﬃciency of 75.29 and an NH3 production rate of 24.05 μg h1 mgcat 1 Figures S26 and S27, Supporting In- formation. Furthermore, it was found that the Cu-Co3O4CuO NBs with heterophase interface also exhibited NH3 synthesis performance comparable to Cu-Co3O4 NBs Faraday eﬃciency, 93.19; yield rate, 59.10 μg h1 mgcat 1, surpassing both pure Co3O4 NBs and some catalysts in the literature under similar conditions Figures S28 and S29; Table S2, Supporting Informa- tion. These electrochemical experimental results indicated that the CuCo dual-site catalyst can enhance NORR performances through a bimetallic synergy eﬀect.45 Subsequently, we delved into the impact of diﬀerent CuCo ratios in the Cu-Co3O4 NBs and Cu-Co3O4CuO NBs on the NORR performance Figures S30S32, Supporting Information. As the Cu content increased, NORR performance increased ﬁrst and then decreased. There was no signiﬁcant decay in the NH3 production rate and Faraday eﬃciency on Cu-Co3O4 NBs at 0.4 V vs. RHE over six cycles, demonstrating the stability of the materials Figure 4c; Figures S33 and S34, Supporting Information. To obtain rigorous stabil- ity data, we conducted a 120-h NORR stability test at 0.4 V vs. RHE Figure S35, Supporting Information. The results showed negligible current decay, with the Faraday eﬃciency and yield of NH3 maintained at 57.38 and 34.06 μg h1 mgcat 1, respectively. Post-stability test characterizations revealed that Cu-Co3O4 NBs retained their original phase structure and composition Figure S36; Table S3, Supporting Information. The performance degra- dation observed may be attributed to localized microstructural changes in the catalysts, as evidenced by TEM analysis showing partial structural collapse of Cu-Co3O4 NBs Figure S37, Support- ing Information.

To elucidate the intricacies of the catalytic mechanism, den- sity functional theory DFT calculations were conducted. Based on the physical characterization results, the Co3O4311, Cu- Co3O4311, and Cu-Co3O4311CuO002 surfaces were chosen for subsequent theoretical studies Figure S45, Supporting Infor- mation. The adsorption energies of NO on diﬀerent adsorption sites of the three catalysts were considered Figure S46, Support- ing Information. Theoretical calculations reveal that the NO ad- sorption energies on the surfaces of Co3O4, Cu-Co3O4, and Cu- Co3O4CuO are 1.81, 1.95, and -2.27 eV, respectively Figure S47, Supporting Information, indicating a signiﬁcant enhance- ment in NO adsorption capacity after constructing the CuCo dual sites. These results are in excellent agreement with the NO- TPD experimental results. Upon the incorporation of Cu, a sig- niﬁcant accumulation of charge density between Co adsite and N atom is observed on the NO adsorbate over Cu-Co3O4 and Cu- Co3O4CuO, while the electron density at the N atom is notably depleted Figure 5a.

This indicates that the addition of Cu atom or CuO in Co3O4 facilitates a higher degree of NO molecule ac- tivation compared to pure Co3O4. The accumulation of charge density around the Cu atoms in Cu-Co3O4 and Cu-Co3O4CuO suggests electron transfer between Co and Cu, which is consis- tent with the XPS analysis.

The higher energy level for Cu 3d orbital of Cu atom near Co adsite in Cu-Co3O4CuO compared to that in Cu-Co3O4 indicates the electron transfer from Co to Cu, which leads to the stronger orbital interaction between Co and N atoms in Cu- Co3O4CuO.

Building on insights from our earlier research and supported by recent theoretical investigations,36,46 the ﬁrst protonation step from NO to NOH is frequently identiﬁed as a pivotal factor and the potential-determining step in the NORR process. As a result, the Cu-Co3O4 demonstrates a signiﬁcantly lower energy barrier 1.07 eV compared to the Cu-Co3O4CuO 1.18 eV and Co3O4 1.31 eV, highlighting a notable improvement in catalytic eﬃciency for the Cu-Co3O4 and Cu-Co3O4CuO.

Zn-NO batteries can maintain their function by switching reaction paths or system design when NH3 generation halts. Speciﬁcally, if NO is depleted, oxygen or air can be intro- duced as a substrate to switch to Zn-air batteries mode, but this transition requires a dual-functional cathode design. This emerg- ing Zn-NO battery shows application potential in areas such as atmospheric pollutant control, distributed ammonia production, and temporary power supply. 3. Conclusion In summary, eﬃcient CuCo dual-sites in hollow cobalt oxide nanoboxes have been developed for the electrocatalytic reduc- tion of low-concentration NO to NH3. Both Cu-Co3O4 NBs and Cu-Co3O4CuO NBs with Cu modiﬁcation exhibit Faraday eﬃ- ciency greater than 93 and ammonia yields up to 59.10 μg h1 mgcat 1 at 0.4 V vs. RHE, surpassing that of 75.29 and 24.05 μg h1 mgcat 1 for the bare Co3O4 NBs. DFT calculations and NO-TPD results demonstrate that Cu modiﬁcation enhances NO adsorption and activation while lowering the energy barrier of the rate-determining step. In a proof-of-concept demonstration, the assembled Zn-NO batteries utilizing Cu-Co3O4 NBs and Cu- Co3O4CuO NBs as electrode materials showcase power densi- ties of 1.58 and 2.02 mW cm2, respectively, with an NH3 yield of 17.66 μg h1 mgcat 1. In this integrated system, NH3 generation, electrical energy output, and NO gas utilization could be achieved simultaneously. This work provides a new strategy for the design of catalysts for electrocatalytic upgrading of low-concentration NO exhaust gas.

This study draws inspiration from desert-dwelling lizards to design a flow-field that increases the performance of the CO2RR in a zero-gap CO2 electrolyzer. It achieves a CO partial current density of 165.5 mA cm2 at 200 mA cm2, surpassing those of conventional parallel and serpentine flow-field designs. Unlike more complex strategies that can only partially prevent water flooding or salt precipitation, our approach achieves both, solely by modifying the cathodic flow-field, while using commercial electrocatalysts, membranes, and standard operating conditions. When doubling the cell size, the lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field significantly boosts CO production: CO selectivity is 46 and 97 higher than for a conventional serpentine flow-field at 350 mA cm2 and 400 mA cm2, respectively. Thus, lizard-inspired flow-field technology could provide a step-change in stable, scalable CO2RR, even using commercially available components for the use of CO2 electrolyzers. I n recent years, there has been growing interest in utilizing renewable energy to drive the electroreduction of carbon dioxide CO2RR, aiming to close the artificial carbon cycle and produce valuable chemicals and fuels.13 The incorporation of gas diffusion layers GDLs and a membrane electrode assembly MEA in the cell architecture of zero-gap CO2 electrolyzers allows this device to reach industrially relevant current densities 200 mA cm2 and selective conversion. GDLs enable high current densities by decreasing the diffusion length of CO2 from the gas phase to the surface of the MEA where catalysis occurs.4 However, the alkaline environment of this device promotes a pathway toward the formation of salt deposits onto the GDLs via the production of carbonates, which impedes CO2 transport to catalytic sites and enhances flooding of the cell, resulting in device failure.410 Strategies to alleviate flooding and salt precipitation in zero-gap CO2 electrolyzers with gas-fed cathodes include i modification of the concentration and composition of the electrolyte,1115 ii alteration of the properties of its cell components such as the GDL and the membrane,5,1620 iii pulsed electrolysis,2124 and iv optimization of the operating conditions.4,8,2528 An additional strategy to circumvent the flooding issue in such electrolyzers is proper modification of the flow-field design, which is a critical but elusive aspect. Flow-field design significantly affects the reactant distribution and mass transport within the electrolyzer.29 A well-designed flow-field ensures uniform delivery of CO2 to the catalyst surface, which enhances its accessibility to catalytic sites, improving the selectivity and yield of the desired products. Recent studies have underscored the significance of flow-field optimization in enhancing CO2 electrolyzer performance.18,30 For instance, interdigitated flow-fields exhibit 45 mA cm2 higher CO2RR current density than their serpentine counter- parts at a gas flow rate of 6 sccm, indicating more efficient",

Recent studies have underscored the significance of flow-field optimization in enhancing CO2 electrolyzer performance.18,30 For instance, interdigitated flow-fields exhibit 45 mA cm2 higher CO2RR current density than their serpentine counter- parts at a gas flow rate of 6 sccm, indicating more efficient transport of gaseous CO2 to the catalyst CuCPTFE.31 The pressure drop on the cathode side of the flow-field plays a critical role in the stable operation of zero-gap CO2 electrolyzers, as it enhances CO2 transport through the GDL and around salt and water blockages.5 In a study using a small-scale cell size of 5.06 cm2, serpentine flow-fields have the highest pressure drop 143 Pa, which is 81 and 143 higher than the interdigitated and parallel flow-fields, respectively, and they Received: April 22, 2025 Revised: June 1, 2025 Accepted: June 2, 2025 Letter http:pubs.acs.orgjournalaelccp XXXX The Authors.

Preliminary results demonstrate that a 50 cm2 spiral flow-field with unidirectional and uniform distribution UDF enhances the mass transport of CO2 to the surface of the MEA and, thus, the production rate of CO maintaining a low pressure drop 6 kPa.33 Herein, we employ our nature-inspired chemical engineering NICE methodology32,3437 to design new flow-fields for zero- gap CO2 electrolyzers, boosting their efficiency via optimized structural features of the flow-fields Figure 1. The NICE approach is based on the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms underpinning desired properties in biological organisms and their implementation in technological applica- tions, without neglecting the differences in context between nature and technology.32,3437 The flow-field design for CO2 electrolyzers herein draws inspiration from desert-dwelling lizards, such as the Australian thorny devil and Texan horned lizard, which possess intricate networks of capillary channels in their integument that facilitate passive water transport.36,37 The lizard-inspired flow-field is designed to improve water manage- ment and enhance mass transport in electrochemical devi- ces;36,37 recently, it has been implemented into polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells PEMFCs showcasing a stable, flood-free operation at 100 relative humidity RH and scalability.36,37 These results suggest that such a lizard-inspired design might also be a promising candidate for the elimination of water flooding and salt precipitation in zero-gap CO2 electro- lyzers. The capillary-driven water transport mechanism used by lizards is implemented by creating capillaries directly on the surface of conventional flow-fields in a zero-gap CO2 electro- lyzer.

The capillary-driven water transport mechanism used by lizards is implemented by creating capillaries directly on the surface of conventional flow-fields in a zero-gap CO2 electro- lyzer. The water transport mechanism, driven by capillary action in the desert-dwelling lizards integument, remains effective when scaled up, as confirmed by quantitative analysis showing that capillary forces dominate over gravitational and viscous forces.37 In our design, hydrophilic capillaries are laser-engraved directly onto the surface of a serpentine flow-field Section S1.3, which is widely used due to its higher pressure drop compared to a parallel flow-field, allowing the continuous transport of reactants through the GDL to the electrocatalyst and ensuring good catalyst utilization.5,38 The positive impact of this design on the wettability of the surface of the flow-field was initially demonstrated via contact angle CA measurements. A water droplet 60 CA on the surface of a lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field rapidly permeates through its structure Video S1, whereas it remains stagnant 90 CA on the surface of a conventional serpentine flow-field, demonstrating that this nature-inspired design effectively enhances passive water transport in the flow-field. Based on these initial promising results, we compare the efficiency and operational stability of a lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field against conventional parallel and serpentine flow-field based CO2 electrolyzers. X- ray microcomputed tomography micro-CT is utilized to gain deeper insights into the electrochemical and structural dynamics within the different flow-fields. Three distinct flow-fields parallel, serpentine, and lizard- inspired serpentine were employed at the cathode side of a zero-gap CO2 electrolyzer to evaluate changes in activity and selectivity of CO2RR on an Ag gas diffusion electrode GDE at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. CO2RR was conducted at discrete current densities: 20, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 mA cm2, with each point held for 20 min under steady-state conditions on electrodes with a geometric area of Figure 1.

This trend is also reflected in the energy efficiency of the CO production Figure 2c. Selectivity is also dependent on the chosen flow-field and applied current density. For all flow-fields tested, CO selectivity decreases as current density increases. At 300 mA cm2, the Faradaic efficiency FE of H2 in parallel, serpentine, and lizard- inspired serpentine flow-field based CO2 electrolyzers reach 59, 39, and 31, respectively Figure 2d, suggesting mass transport limitations arise, lowering CO2 utilization and favoring the hydrogen evolution reaction HER.5 To gain further insights into the observed phenomena, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed Figure S4. High-frequency resistance HFR, or Ohmic resistance and total charge transfer resistance of the cell are derived from equivalent circuit modeling Figure S4a.39 The HFR for all flow-fields remains relatively constant, between 0.5 and 1.0 Ω cm2, due to employing the same electrolyte Figure S4c. Analysis of the HFR suggests that the increase in voltage e.g., 3.76 V for serpentine vs 3.70 V for a lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field at 250 mA cm2 in Figure 2a is attributed to a higher HFR e.g., 0.71 Ω cm2 for serpentine vs 0.45 Ω cm2 for a lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field at 250 mA cm2 in Figure S4c and potential degradation of the membrane, exacerbated at higher current densities.39,40 The disparity in FECO between serpentine and lizard-inspired serpentine flow- fields Figure 2d is likely due to mechanical stress on the membrane during electrolysis, which is an additional result of membrane dehydration.39 Figure S4b illustrates more significant differences in the Nyquist plots among the different flow-fields, particularly at low frequencies. The low-frequency resistance dominates at low current densities but decreases significantly with increasing current density, suggesting that a substantial portion is related to charge transfer resistance Figure S4d.39 The lower charge transfer resistance of a lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field compared to a serpentine flow-field at higher current densities reflects enhanced charge transferability, and reduced polarization losses during CO2RR.41,42 To evaluate the stability of these zero-gap CO2 electrolyzers, the CO2RR was conducted over 24 h at 200 mA cm2 Figure Figure 2. a Cell voltage, b average partial current density of CO, c energy efficiency of CO production, and d total Faradaic efficiency CO-bottom bars, H2-top bars for parallel, serpentine, and lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field based CO2 electrolyzers.

As the CO2RR progresses, only the lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field maintains a stable cell voltage 3.5 V and CO selectivity 81.3 throughout the operation of the device Figure 3b, indicating that CO2 has access to the catalytic sites of the MEA and, thus, flooding is avoided. On the contrary, in the case of parallel and serpentine flow-fields, there is a gradual increase in cell voltage accompanied by a decrease in CO selectivity. After 10 h of operation, there is a sudden drop of the cell voltage for the parallel flow-field, coinciding with a drastic reduction in CO selectivity to 6.4 due to salt precipitation Figure 3d and flooding, boosting H2 selectivity to 50 Figure 3c. The parallel flow-field fails to operate past this point. For the serpentine flow-field, the cell voltage increases steadily over the first 22 h and then decreases, suggesting local membrane- electrode delamination or electrolyte breakthrough, likely induced by severe salt accumulation. This voltage collapse is accompanied by a reduction in CO selectivity of 21 after 24 h of operation, along with increased H2 selectivity 20, consistent with performance losses due to flooding and salt blockage, which is clearly visible on the back of the cathode side of the Ag GDEs post electrolysis Figure 3d. XRD measurements Figure S5 of Ag GDEs show that the crystallographic planes of Ag remain unchanged after CO2 electrolysis,43 while the emergence of additional peaks marked with blue diamonds indicates the formation of KHCO3 during the reaction of hydrogen peroxide, a byproduct of CO2RR, with the anolyte.8 The presence of Ag and K on Ag GDEs is also confirmed by SEM Figure S6. The formation of salt precipitates within the GDE poses a significant challenge to the stable operation of zero-gap electrolyzers with an alkaline anolyte. A higher concentration of K leads to a reduction in FECO due to an increase in the electro-osmotic drag of water, exacerbating flooding of the cathode and resulting in increased mass transport limitations for CO2RR.7 Micro-CT imaging was employed to quantitatively evaluate the salt precipitation on all flow-fields after durability measurement Figure S7. The minimal Ag presence in the fresh GDE is due to the initial infiltration of Ag nanoparticles during electrode preparation. In contrast, increased brightness is highlighted in the GDLs post electrolysis, indicating localized accumulation of K, likely resulting from uneven distribution of reactants. However, compared to the lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field with only few bright spots, the parallel and serpentine flow-fields show widespread and uneven accumulation of K.

A relatively loose layer of dispersed Ag particles is present on fresh GDE Figure 4a. Notably, a significantly higher number of precipitates is observed within the GDEs mounted on parallel and serpentine flow-fields compared to the GDE on lizard- inspired serpentine flow-field, suggesting greater potassium salt accumulation in the GDL pores, which impedes CO2 transport to the catalytic sites Figure 4a.44 The GDL on the serpentine flow-field contains the highest amount of salt precipitates Figure 4b-c, with their quantities in the GDLs for the parallel, serpentine, and lizard-inspired serpentine flow-fields being 149, 377, and 72, respectively. Specifically, at a depth between 100200 μm, the metal fraction in the Ag GDE of the serpentine flow-field reaches 610, while in the lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field it remains below 1. Even though the parallel flow-field operates flood-free for 10 h, severe salt precipitation and significant flooding occurs thereafter, as indicated by the faults observed in the GDL Figure S8b, Figure S9b. Additionally, the lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field shows significantly fewer large precipitates within the GDL compared to the parallel and serpentine flow fields Figure 4c. A histogram of the size distribution of metal Ag or Ag and K within the GDL depth: 100350 μm of these flow-fields was constructed, revealing that the number of precipitates larger than 1000 μm3 is 19 in the parallel flow-field, 36 in the serpentine flow-field, and only 6 in the lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field Figure 4c. These observations indicate increased potassium salt precipitation in parallel and serpentine flow-fields, correlating with their degradation in FECO. There- fore, upon the incorporation of the lizard-inspired capillary microchannels onto the conventional serpentine flow-field, the amount of salt is minimized due to efficient water management. These promising results are obtained when capillary micro- channels are incorporated within a flow-field for a geometric MEA area of 2.25 cm2. At such small scale, the distribution of CO2 within the flow-field and the removal of products are inherently more uniform.33 However, as the size of the electrolyzer increases and higher",

This upscaling was performed to test the robustness of the flow-field design under increased spatial constraints. The lizard- inspired serpentine flow-field retains its properties effectively, maintaining a higher CO selectivity and reduced H2 formation at current densities exceeding 200 mA cm2 Figure S10a-c. At 300 mA cm2, the CO selectivity of the lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field is 21 and 16 higher than that of the serpentine flow-field at cell sizes of 2.25 cm2 and 5.06 cm2, respectively. Furthermore, at current densities of 350 mA cm2 and 400 mA cm2, the CO selectivity exceeds that of the traditional serpentine flow-field by 46 and 97, respectively, for a cell size of 5.06 cm2. The lizard-inspired design enhances gas flow management and mass transport dynamics, ensuring efficient removal of salt byproducts and water.36,37 The lizard- inspired serpentine flow-field 5.06 cm2 still has a minimal amount of salt precipitate Figure S11c, while high salt precipitation on the back of the cathode side of the Ag GDE is observed for the parallel flow-field, where the channels are flooded Figure S11a. This improvement is critical for sustaining a high CO2RR efficiency and selectivity in larger devices. Moreover, the lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field achieves these enhancements without incurring additional voltage penalties Figure S10d. This characteristic is partic- ularly advantageous, as it allows for improved performance and selectivity without compromising the overall energy efficiency of the system. In summary, this study highlights the significant impact of a nature-inspired flow-field design on the activity and stability of the CO2RR in zero-gap electrolyzers, building on its proven success in PEMFCs.

The comparative analysis of parallel, serpentine, and lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field based CO2 electrolyzers reveals that while all designs exhibit comparable performance at lower current densities, significant differences arise at higher current densities. Specifically, at 200 mA cm2, the lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field achieves a maximum partial current density for CO of 165.5 mA cm2, outperforming both the parallel and serpentine flow-fields. This indicates that the lizard-inspired design is more effective in overcoming mass transport limitations and sustaining the CO selectivity under high current densities. Furthermore, the lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field shows superior stability, maintaining a stable cell voltage and a CO selectivity of approximately 81.3 over 24 h at 200 mA cm2. In contrast, the conventional serpentine flow-field experiences a decrease in CO selectivity, although it is less severe than the parallel flow-field, which suffers a sharp decline in CO selectivity to 6.4 after just 10 h. These variations are largely attributed to the effective management of water and reduced salt precipitation afforded by the lizard- inspired design. Micro-CT analysis confirms that the lizard- inspired serpentine flow-field has minimal salt crystal formation, which prevents the blockage of the active sites of the catalyst and gas transport channels, further underscoring its potential for enhancing CO2RR performance. The observed salt precipitation detailed in the above sections contradicts earlier reports in the literature suggesting that a low concentration of the anolyte combined with an anion exchange membrane-based MEA can avoid salt precipitation.8,45 Even an anolyte containing 0.1 M KHCO3 combined with a Sustainion- based MEA leads to significant salt concentration after short operation of the CO2 electrolyzer. While the field of CO2RR has advanced significantly in catalyst development and optimization of operating conditions, flow field design remains an underrepresented area despite its critical influence on performance and scalability of the CO2 electrolyzer, as evidenced by the limited number of publications on this topic. A recent report investigated the uniform distribution of CO2 across the catalyst layer via a multiserpentine flow field design achieving 12 h of stable operation at 100 mA cm2.46 However, the optimization of gas flow alone within the flow field is insufficient; our study goes beyond the uniformity of the CO2 distribution, directly addressing critical challenges such as water flooding and salt precipitation through a nature- inspired flow field design achieving superior stability with 24 h of operation at 200 mA cm2. Another report investigates the influence of operating parameters, namely anolyte concen- tration, cation species, membrane thickness, and temperature, on cation accumulation and salt formation.47 The combination of optimal parameters results in a 144 h stable operation at 200 mA cm2 with no measurable salt deposition. However, under the same operating conditions as in our study 0.1 M KHCO3, room temperature, 50 μm thick Sustainion membrane, 200 mA cm2, the operation of the device fails after only 100 min. In",

However, under the same operating conditions as in our study 0.1 M KHCO3, room temperature, 50 μm thick Sustainion membrane, 200 mA cm2, the operation of the device fails after only 100 min. In contrast, our work employs a single, practical strategy that effectively prevents water flooding and salt accumulation without relying on complex parameter combinations, resulting in a stable 24 h operation at 200 mA cm2. Thus, none of the other proposed strategies addition of solvents to the cathode to dissolve and remove precipitates, rinsing of the cell, modified polymer membranes, optimization of the operating conditions have emerged as a single standalone solution to this issue. They are always combined, e.g. cell rinsing and optimal operating conditions, to enable long-term operation, hereby increasing the complexity of the electrolyzer setup and the electrochemical measurements.4,8,47,48 On the contrary, our nature-inspired approach circumvents water flooding and salt precipitation on the GDE via sole modification of the cathodic flow-field. Commercial electrocatalysts and membranes are used for the preparation of GDE, while common operating conditions are utilized. This reduces the cost and complexity of the CO2RR setup allowing the stable operation of the zero-gap electrolyzer. Future research should focus on several key areas to further enhance the CO2RR performance and scalability. Increasing the cell size beyond the tested 5.06 cm2 value will help assess the effectiveness for larger, industrially relevant systems. Addition- ally, optimizing operational parameters such as flow rate, anolyte composition and concentration, temperature, pressure, as well as pulsed electrolysisan area that remains scarcely explored in current literaturecould further improve performance by better preventing the formation of carbonate salt. Moreover, extending stability tests beyond 24 h will be essential to validate long-term durability under practical conditions. Such studies could incorporate periodic electrochemical diagnostics and post-mortem structural analysis to monitor degradation phenomena over time. Furthermore, integrating computational fluid dynamics CFD simulations to elucidate the impact of flow field design on CO2 transport and saltwater blockages could bridge gaps in mechanistic understanding and guide the rational design of the CO2RR systems.

Herein, a series of NiOH2 samples with well-defined morphologies i.e., nanorod and nanosheet and crystal structures i.e., α and β phases were synthesized and evaluated for electrochemical conversion of KA oil. The catalytic performance of the samples was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry CV, linear sweep voltammetry LSV, and chronoamperometric tests. The products of KA oil oxidation were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography HPLC. Among the samples, the α- NiOH2 nanorod exhibited the best electrochemical activity, with a maximum current density of 17.6 mA mg1 at 1.57 V. Such superior activity is related to the large surface area and formation of active NiOOH at lower potentials. HPLC results indicate that the β-NiOH2 nanosheet exhibited the highest adipic acid selectivity of 26 at 1.63 V. Notably, the α-NiOH2 nanosheet shows both poor activity and product selectivity. Open-circuit potential OCP and double-layer capacitance Cdl measurements demonstrated that the adsorption capacity of KA oil over the samples follows the sequence of β-NiOH2 nanosheet α-NiOH2 nanorod α-NiOH2 nanosheet. Operando Raman and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy EIS results suggest that the oxidation of KA oil by the α-NiOH2 nanorod mainly follows the indirect oxidation mechanism, while the oxidation of KA oil by the α-NiOH2 nanosheet follows the direct oxidation mechanism. For the β-NiOH2 nanosheet, both direct and indirect oxidations of KA oil take place. KEYWORDS: nickel-based electrocatalysts, biomass conversion, KA oil conversion, adipic acid electrosynthesis, operando Raman 1. INTRODUCTION KA oil, composed of cyclohexanone K and cyclohexanol A, serves as a crucial platform chemical for the chemical industry. Adipic acid AA, obtained by oxidizing KA oil, is a major industrial chemical with an estimated annual value of ca. 6.3 billion worldwide.1,2 The substantial demand for AA can be attributed to its diverse applications in the chemical, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food processing industries.37 With technological advancements, the application scope of AA is expected to expand.8,9 In current industrial processes, the conversion of KA oil into AA is conducted by concentrated nitric acid using copperammonium metavanadate as the catalyst.4,10 However, this process exhibits a low yield of AA in a single production.11 Furthermore, this process involves the use of excess nitric acid, which leads to the generation of greenhouse gas N2O, causing ozone depletion, acid rain, and global warming.12 Obviously, developing a green and efficient method for AA synthesis is an urgent priority. The electro- chemical conversion of organic substrates into high-value- added compounds is regarded as a promising synthetic approach.1316 In a typical electrosynthesis process, electrons act as intrinsic clean reagents, utilizing water as the source of hydrogen or oxygen. This approach eliminates the necessity for additional chemical oxidants, avoiding the use of toxic reagents.1719 Owing to the merits of environmental friend- liness, to date, electrochemical approaches",

This approach eliminates the necessity for additional chemical oxidants, avoiding the use of toxic reagents.1719 Owing to the merits of environmental friend- liness, to date, electrochemical approaches have been studied for the synthesis of chemicals.2025 Electrocatalytic oxidation offers a green and efficient strategy for converting KA oil to AA.2628 High-performance electro- catalysts are essential for the application of electrochemical processes. Nickel-based catalysts are widely recognized as promising electrode materials due to exceptional catalytic properties, high natural abundance, and remarkable stabil- ity.2932 The earliest work on electro-oxidation of A to AA was reported by Lyalin and Petrosyan in 2004,33 where a nickel oxyhydroxide NiOOH catalyst achieved an AA yield of 11 via a two-step oxidation process when A was used as the Received: October 6, 2024 Revised: April 21, 2025 Accepted: May 21, 2025 Research Article pubs.acs.orgacscatalysis XXXX American Chemical Society 10591 https:doi.org10.1021acscatal.4c06137 ACS Catal. 2025, 15, 1059110600 Downloaded via TSINGHUA UNIV on June 15, 2025 at 07:46:55 UTC.

Since then, advancements have been achieved in the development of nickel-based catalysts for improving the catalytic performance, in terms of product selectivity and KA conversion. For example, Gong et al. demonstrated that introducing Cu2 into NiOH2 can effectively promote Cα-Cβ cleavage of A.20 Duans research group found that modifying NiOH2 with sodium dodecyl sulfonate SDS and vanadium V significantly improved catalytic performance because SDS facilitates K enrichment on the catalyst surface and V can accelerate catalyst reconstruction and strengthen K adsorption.26,34 Our group has recently reported a manganese-doped NiOH2 catalyst, which possessed good activity and product selectivity because manganese can modify the adsorption of the substrates.35 Jia et al. studied the mechanism of KA oil oxidation over the NiOH2 catalyst and found that Ni3 is responsible for A hydrogenation to K, while oxygen vacancy is crucial for the subsequent oxidation of K to AA.29 Though efforts have been devoted to this research topic, there are few studies on the dependence of KA oil oxidation on the morphology and crystal phase of NiOH2. In this study, we synthesized nickel hydroxides with controlled morphologies i.e., nanorod and nanosheet and crystal phases α and β phases for the electrochemical conversion of KA oil. The electrochemical measurements indicated that the α-NiOH2 nanorod α-NiOH2NR has the best electrochemical activity, yielding a maximum current density of 17.6 mA mg1 at 1.57 V. Additionally, operando electrochemical Raman spectra revealed that α-NiOH2NR exhibited a lower potential of 1.43 V for the formation active NiOOH. High- performance liquid chromatography HPLC results indicate that the β-NiOH2 nanosheet β-NiOH2NS exhibits the highest AA selectivity of 26 at 1.63 V. Notably, the α- NiOH2 nanosheet α-NiOH2NS shows poor electro- chemical activity and product selectivity. To gain mechanistic insights, open-circuit potential OCP and",

Notably, the α- NiOH2 nanosheet α-NiOH2NS shows poor electro- chemical activity and product selectivity. To gain mechanistic insights, open-circuit potential OCP and double-layer capacitance Cdl measurements have been conducted. This work affords new insights on the dependence of KA oil oxidation on the structure of nickel hydroxides. 2. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION 2.1. Methods.

For the preparation of β-NiOH2NS, the procedures are the same, except that 20 mmol of NaOH was used. For the preparation of α-NiOH2NS, 0.3490 g of NiNO326H2O, 0.3604 g of urea, 0.0889 g of NH4F, and 30 mL of DI water were prepared for the hydrothermal process. After centrifugation, the obtained products were washed with ethanol and DI water and then dried for further use. 2.2. Structure Characterization.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1. Structural Characterization. The morphologies of the as-synthesized samples are characterized, as shown in Figure 1. In general, pH is critical for the phase stability of NiOH2 and a specific surfactant can alter the reaction interface and adjust the crystal growth direction. Consequently, control synthesis can be achieved by adjusting the pH and surfactant of the reaction system.36 Figure 1a,b illustrates the representative FESEM and TEM overview images of α- NiOH2NR, which exhibit a typical rod-like structure with an approximate diameter of 13 nm Figure S1a. The HRTEM image in Figure 1c reveals well-defined lattice fringes in α- NiOH2NR with a measured spacing of 0.218 nm in region 1. Correlating this observation with the standard card ICDD No. 00-022-0444 from the XRD database presented in Table S1, it can be determined that this lattice spacing corresponds to the 103 planes of α-NiOH2. As shown in Figure 1d,e, α-NiOH2NS exhibits a sheet-like morphology with an average lateral size of ca. 110 nm Figure S1b. HRTEM analysis Figure 1f further confirms the crystalline structure, where the measured lattice spacing of 0.219 nm in region 2 corresponds to the 103 planes of α-NiOH2. In contrast, β-NiOH2NS Figure 1g,h consists of smaller nanosheets ca. 58 nm, Figure S1c, and its HRTEM image Figure 1i reveals a distinct lattice spacing of 0.265 nm in region 3. Combined with the standard card ICDD No. 00- 001-1047 Table S2 of the XRD database, it can be inferred that this lattice spacing is ascribed to the 100 planes of β- NiOH2. These results indicate the successful synthesis of NiOH2 with well-defined morphologies. The XRD results of the as-synthesized samples are presented in Figure 1j. The diffraction peaks of β-NiOH2NS are well aligned with the standard card ICDD No. 00-001-1047, confirming the formation of the β-NiOH2 crystalline phase. Specifically, the diffraction peaks at ca. 19, 33.2, and 38.6 correspond to the 001, 100, and 101 crystal planes of β- NiOH2, respectively. The diffraction peaks of the α- NiOH2-NS sample can be indexed to the standard card ICDD No. 00-022-0444, demonstrating that",

Specifically, the diffraction peaks at ca. 19, 33.2, and 38.6 correspond to the 001, 100, and 101 crystal planes of β- NiOH2, respectively. The diffraction peaks of the α- NiOH2-NS sample can be indexed to the standard card ICDD No. 00-022-0444, demonstrating that the sample is primarily composed of α-NiOH2. Specifically, the peaks at ca. 11.6, 23, 33.7, 34.5, 38.9, and 59.9 correspond to the 001, 002, 110, 111, 103, and 300 crystal planes of α-NiOH2, respectively. However, a meticulous analysis indicates that several characteristic peaks in the XRD pattern do not align with the standard card, potentially due to the presence of a minor quantity of β-NiOH2. The synthesis of high-purity α-NiOH2 poses significant challenges.39 Like- wise, the XRD pattern of α-NiOH2-NR displays distinct peak shifts and broadening, which may be ascribed to the presence of β-NiOH2 impurities, variable hydration, and crystal defects.4042 Raman spectra were further employed to investigate the structural features of the samples, as illustrated in Figure 1k. The Raman results reveal significant differences in the characteristic peaks among the samples. According to group theory, β-NiOH2 exhibits four fundamental vibrational modes 2A1g 2Eg, which are typically observed in the spectral regions of 310318, 445453, and 3581 cm1.43 A meticulous analysis of the spectrum of β-NiOH2NS reveals characteristic peaks at 310 and 446 cm1, which are assigned to the EgR and A1gT vibrational modes of β-NiOH2, respectively.44 Additionally, the peak observed at 880 cm1 ACS Catalysis pubs.acs.orgacscatalysis Research Article https:doi.org10.1021acscatal.4c06137 ACS Catal. 2025, 15, 1059110600 10593 corresponds to the lattice vibration of β-NiOH2.39 In contrast, α-NiOH2 usually shows structural irregularities,45 resulting in some differences in the observed peaks. Upon thorough analysis of the spectrum of α-NiOH2NS, a characteristic peak at 470 cm1 is ascribed to the lattice vibration of α-NiOH2, whereas the peak at 1044 cm1 is attributed to the intercalation of NO3 ions between the layers. Additionally, the characteristic peak observed at ca. 1400 cm1 may be due to the splitting of the OH bending mode within the lattice OH caused by the structural disorder.46 The peak at ca. 490 cm1 in the α-NiOH2NR spectrum also arises from the α-NiOH2 lattice vibrations. Notably, the peaks observed at 451, 607, 986, and 1105 cm1 can be attributed to the intercalation of SO4 2in the sample. The N2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the samples were recorded to determine their specific surface areas, as illustrated in Figure 1l. Among the synthesized samples, α-NiOH2NR exhibits the largest BET surface area of 91.1 m2 g1, exceeding those of β-NiOH2NS 55.6 m2 g1 and α-NiOH2NS 6.6 m2 g1. 3.2. Electrochemical Performance. Since K and A share an identical reaction pathway and pure KA is rarely employed in industrial processes,20 we prepared KA oil by mixing equimolar quantities of K and A 1:1 to simulate industrial feedstock conditions. The electrochemical properties of the resulting samples were investigated by using cyclic voltamme- try CV and linear sweep voltammetry LSV. As shown in Figure 2a, the CV curve",

The electrochemical properties of the resulting samples were investigated by using cyclic voltamme- try CV and linear sweep voltammetry LSV. As shown in Figure 2a, the CV curve of α-NiOH2NR in 1 M KOH solutions reveals an oxidation peak at a potential of 1.42 V, corresponding to the oxidation of Ni2.26,29,47 As the scanning potential continues to increase, a rise in the current density is observed, signifying the onset of the oxygen evolution reaction OER. Similar characteristics are noted from the LSV curve see Figure 2e. Notably, following the addition of 0.1 M KA oil, a higher oxidation peak emerges at a potential of 1.56 V, which is attributed to the oxidation of the KA oil. Specifically, the peak current density for KA oil oxidation in the CV curve of α-NiOH2NR reaches 34.2 mA mg1. Correspondingly, a larger oxidation peak is observed in the LSV results at the same potential, as shown in Figure 2e. The occurrence of the OER subsequently initiates after the oxidation of KA oil, indicating that the oxidation of KA oil has a competitive advantage over the OER. The CV curve of α-NiOH2NS see Figure 2b, similar to that of α-NiOH2NR, exhibits an oxidation peak for Ni2 at 1.41 V in 1 M KOH solutions. After the addition of 0.1 M KA oil, a higher oxidation peak emerges at ca. 1.53 V, which is associated with the oxidation of KA oil. Compared to α-NiOH2NR, α-NiOH2NS demonstrates a lower current density for KA oil oxidation. Specifically, the CV curve indicates a current density of only 2.3 mA mg1 for KA oil oxidation. As depicted in Figure 2c, the CV curve of β- NiOH2NS in 1 M KOH solutions exhibits an oxidation peak at 1.46 V, indicative of the oxidation of Ni2. Upon the introduction of 0.1 M KA oil, the CV curve demonstrates the presence of a shoulder peak located at ca. 1.52 V, which is attributed to the oxidation of the KA oil. Compared to α- NiOH2NS, β-NiOH2NS demonstrates an increased current density for KA oil oxidation. Specifically, the peak current density for KA oil oxidation in the CV curve of the β- NiOH2NS sample is 4.5 mA mg1. Previous studies have confirmed the irreversible phase transition from α-NiOH2 to β-NiOH2 in alkaline solutions, especially under electrochemical conditions.48,49 To evaluate the stability of α-NiOH2NS under the operational conditions, TEM characterization of the catalyst after 4 h electrolysis at 1.63 V was performed.

Additionally, after 4 h electrolysis, CV tests of 100 cycles see Figure S2b were performed, which exhibited negligible peak potential shifts, further proving the structural stability of α-NiOH2NS in 1 M KOH 0.1 M KA oil solutions. Figure 2d compares the LSV curves of the three samples in 1 M KOH with and without 0.1 M KA oil solutions. In the absence of KA oil, all three samples show similar OER characteristics, with an onset potential of ca. 1.51 V following a weak peak associated with the oxidation of Ni2 ca. 1.39 V. Notably, α-NiOH2NS has a low current density due to its small BET surface area Figure 1l. Upon KA oil addition, the current densities of the samples increase, and the onset potential of KA oil oxidation is much lower than that of the OER, indicating that KA oil oxidation is more favorable than the OER. The α-NiOH2NR catalysts exhibited a peak current density of 17.6 mA mg1, substantially outperforming both β-NiOH2NS 5.05 mA mg1 and α-NiOH2NS 1.71 mA mg1. The introduction of KA oil significantly accelerated the reaction kinetics of α-NiOH2NR, manifested by shifting the polarization curve toward lower voltages by 156 mV at a current density of 5 mA mg1. The energy efficiency of KA oxidation by α-NiOH2NS and β-NiOH2NS is also superior relative to that of the OER see Figure 2e. Meanwhile, the Tafel slopes of the samples were determined Figure 2f. Specifically, the Tafel slope values for OER and KA oil oxidation of α-NiOH2NS are 85.9 and 53.7 mV dec1, respectively, which are lower than those of α-NiOH2 NR 87.7 and 57.8 mV dec1 and β-NiOH2NS 98.4 and 107.9 mV dec1. 3.3. Analysis of Products. To determine the products of KA oil electro-oxidation, an electrolysis process was conducted in an H-type cell. The concentration of the products and substrates was analyzed by HPLC. First, cyclohexanol A, cyclohexanone K, and several possible carboxylic acids, including adipic acid AA, glutaric acid GA, and succinic acid SA, were identified by HPLC, and a variety of standard curves were established to accurately determine their concentrations see Figures S3, S4a, and S5a. It should be pointed out that AA, GA, and SA are the most desirable products from the oxidation of KA oil. However, some other byproducts could be possibly present in the electrolytes but not analyzed in this work. In addition, to verify the degradation of KA oil in 1 M KOH solutions without electrolysis, 50 mM KA oil was placed under the same",

In addition, to verify the degradation of KA oil in 1 M KOH solutions without electrolysis, 50 mM KA oil was placed under the same reaction conditions without performing electrolysis at various times. As shown in Figure S6, the conversion rates of KA oil after 2, 4, and 20 h were 0.9, 1.6, and 5.3, respectively. This extremely low degradation rate is considered to be negligible. Furthermore, no degradation products were detected at the 4 h time point, confirming that the observed degradation had no significant impact on the experimental results. The conversion of KA oil and resulting products obtained from the samples are shown in Figures 3ac and S4bd. In the process of KA oil oxidation, the electrolysis potential is one of the important factors that influences product distribution. Understanding the effects of electrolysis potential on product distribution is desirable for rational control of the target product. Thus, the product distribution of KA oil oxidation by the three catalysts at different applied potentials was investigated. α-NiOH2NR yields AA selectivities of 7.4, 11.0, and 14.1 at applied potentials of 1.43, 1.53, and 1.63 V, respectively. Notably, no GA was detected at 1.43 V, while GA selectivities of 7.98 and 10.3 were obtained at 1.53 and 1.63 Figure 3. Analysis of the Products of KA oil oxidation by the as-synthesized catalysts.

The α-NiOH2NS yields AA selectivities of 5.8, 10.3, and 16.3 at 1.43, 1.53, and 1.63 V, respectively. No GA was detected at 1.43 V, while GA selectivities of 7.6 and 23.7 were obtained at 1.53 and 1.63 V, respectively. At 1.63 V, α- NiOH2NS yields a SA selectivity of 6.2. The β-NiOH2 NS yields AA selectivities of 6.3, 22.9, and 26.0 at 1.43, 1.53, and 1.63 V, respectively. Similarly, no detection of GA was observed at 1.43 V, while GA selectivities of 6.6 and 9.1 were obtained at 1.53 and 1.63 V, respectively. Additionally, SA was observed only at 1.63 V, with a selectivity value of 4.2. The results presented above suggest that the selectivity for AA, GA, and SA of the three catalysts increases with an increasing applied potential. At 1.63 V, the ranking of AA selectivity among the three catalysts follows the sequence of β-NiOH2 NS α-NiOH2NR α-NiOH2NS. Consequently, β- NiOH2NS exhibits the most optimal AA selectivity of 26.0 at 1.63 V for 4 h electrolysis. This could be related to the adsorption of the substrates and intermediates. As illustrated",

As illustrated in Figures 3d and S5bd, the conversion of KA oil at varying potentials aligns with the aforementioned observations. Briefly, as the applied potential increases, the KA oil conversion of the samples also rises. However, a close inspection could reveal that the KA oil conversion of α- NiOH2NS at 1.53 V does not exhibit a significant increase compared to 1.43 V, while there is a notable increase in product selectivity, potentially attributed to the fact that α- NiOH2NS produced more byproducts at 1.43 V. Notably, β-NiOH2NS exhibits the highest conversion of 30.9 at 1.63 V for 4 h electrolysis, which may be due to the fact that the main exposed crystal plane in β-NiOH2NS is 100, while that in α-NiOH2NR and α-NiOH2NS is 103 as shown in Figure 1c,f,i.

To further explore the effects of substrate concentration on the product distribution of KA oil oxidation, chronoamperometric tests were conducted for 4 h in the electrolytes with varying KA oil concentrations at 1.63 V. The products of KA oil oxidation and KA oil conversion obtained from the β-NiOH2NS are illustrated in Figures 3e, S4e, and S5e. AA selectivity of the sample increases from 16.6 to 26.0 as the substrate concentration gradually increases from 10 to 50 mM and decreases with a further increase in substrate concentration to 100 mM, leading to a maximum value of 50 mM. Using 50 mM KA oil as the substrate, the selectivity for side products such as GA and SA is quite limited. With the increase of substrate concentration, the conversion rate of KA oil shows little variation, indicating that within the range of 25100 mM, the conversion of KA oil by β- NiOH2NS is not dependent on substrate concentration. These findings suggest that a substrate concentration of 50 mM is optimal for the selective oxidation of KA oil into AA on the electrode surface, which could be related to the adsorption of the substrates on the electrode",

These findings suggest that a substrate concentration of 50 mM is optimal for the selective oxidation of KA oil into AA on the electrode surface, which could be related to the adsorption of the substrates on the electrode surface and subsequent oxidation kinetics.29 In addition, β-NiOH2NS was used to perform constant potential electrolysis of KA oil at 1.63 V for 10 h. The product distribution and KA oil conversion at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h are illustrated in Figures 3f, S4f, and S5f. Throughout the electrolysis, AA is the primary product of KA oil oxidation, and the selectivities of AA, GA, and SA increase with electrolysis time. Specifically, the selectivity of AA is increased from 9.1 to 27.0. The conversion of KA oil also increases with time, reaching 57.5 after 10 h of electrolysis. Within the initial 2 h of electrolysis, the selectivity of AA exhibits a rapid increase, reaching 17.7. However, during the subsequent period of 210 h, AA selectivity slowly increases. Instead, the selectivity of the byproducts, including GA and SA, has demonstrated a steady increase during this period. Notably, the maximum selectivity for GA reaches 15.0. 3.4. Mechanistic Studies on KA Oil Electro-Oxidation. To gain insights into the mechanism of KA oil oxidation, the adsorption behavior of KA oil over the catalysts was first studied by measuring the OCP, which reflects the variation of absorbates within the Helmholtz layer.51 In 1 M KOH solutions, the primary adsorbed species are typically water molecules and K and OHions. As shown in Figure 4a, β- NiOH2NS exhibits the highest OCP before the addition of KA oil, likely resulting from its smallest electrochemical active surface area ECSA and, therefore, the least adsorption of these species. However, upon the introduction of KA oil, the adsorbed species expanded to include water molecules and K, OH, and KA oil molecules in solution. Consequently, the observed difference in the OCP can be attributed to the adsorption of KA oil molecules. Specifically, after KA oil was injected, a more noticeable decrease in OCP of the β- NiOH2NS electrode Δ 395 mV was detected compared with those of α-NiOH2NR Δ 270 mV and α-NiOH2 NS Δ 112 mV, revealing that the absorption capacity of KA oil over the three samples follows the order of β-NiOH2 NS α-NiOH2NR α-NiOH2NS. In addition, Raman spectra were used to investigate the adsorption properties of the samples see Figure S7a. For clarity, the Raman spectra of KA oil, K, and A solutions and carbon paper were also recorded see Figure S7b. The band assignments were made by referencing established experimental and theoretical studies.52,53 In 1 M KOH solutions, no other peaks are noted, except those of carbon supports. In contrast, additional peaks at 2863, 2907, and 2951 cm1 are noted in 1 M KOH 0.1 M KA oil solutions, which were attributed to the vibration of CH groups from the carbon rings, indicative of the adsorption of",

In contrast, additional peaks at 2863, 2907, and 2951 cm1 are noted in 1 M KOH 0.1 M KA oil solutions, which were attributed to the vibration of CH groups from the carbon rings, indicative of the adsorption of KA oil onto the samples.35 In the vicinity of OCP, the variation of the adsorbates within the Helmholtz layer could substantially influence the Cdl of the electrode.51,53 Thus, measuring the Cdl values provides insights into the KA oil oxidation mechanism of the synthesized catalysts. Within the non-Faradaic region, the CV curves were recorded at varying scan rates, as shown in Figures S8 and S9. The current at the anodic sweep ia and cathodic sweep ic were recorded, and their difference Δi was determined by Δi ia ic2. The slope of the linear fitting of Δi against the scan rate corresponded to the value of Cdl see Figure 4b,c. The Cdl values of α-NiOH2NR, α-NiOH2NS, and β- NiOH2NS in 1 M KOH 0.1 M KA oil solutions are 3.11, 3.45, and 2.84 μF, respectively. The ECSA was derived by dividing the Cdl by the specific capacitance Cs 40 μF cm2.54,55 The ECSA values of the samples were determined to be 0.078, 0.086, and 0.071 cm2, respectively, which primarily arise from crystallographic phase effects and morphological differences.50 Specifically, the α-NiOH2NS samples exhibit a loosely stacked layered structure compared to that of β- NiOH2NS, and the NiOH2 nanosheets typically possess a higher density of exposed edge sites and structural defects compared to nanorods, contributing to the enhanced ECSA despite their larger lateral size. To verify the potential influence of surface modification induced by urea on the ECSA of α- NiOH2NS, the Cdl values of α-NiOH2NS in 1 M KOH 0.1 M KA oil 0.05 M urea solutions were also determined. The resulting value was compared with that obtained in 1 M KOH 0.1 M KA oil solutions, as shown in Figure S10. Specifically, the Cdl of α-NiOH2NS exhibits a slight increase from 3.45 to 3.56 μF upon adding urea, suggesting that urea had little effect on the ECSA of α-NiOH2NS. Notably, the catalytic activity of the samples does not correlate well with their Cdl values, suggesting that the catalytic oxidation activity of the samples toward KA oil is determined by factors beyond the ECSA. To reveal the intrinsic activity, the ECSA- normalized current density was plotted against potential, as shown in Figure S11a. Figure S11b comparatively shows the intrinsic activity of the three samples for KA oil oxidation and the OER. Interestingly, the ECSA-normalized current density of the three samples follows the order of α-NiOH2NR β- NiOH2NS α-NiOH2NS, which is consistent with that of mass-normalized current density see Figure 2d,e. However, the BET surface area-normalized current density of the three samples follows the sequence of α-NiOH2NS α- NiOH2NR β-NiOH2NS see Figure S12, which is due to the fact that α-NiOH2NS with a loosely stacked layered structure exhibits the smallest BET surface area and",

However, the BET surface area-normalized current density of the three samples follows the sequence of α-NiOH2NS α- NiOH2NR β-NiOH2NS see Figure S12, which is due to the fact that α-NiOH2NS with a loosely stacked layered structure exhibits the smallest BET surface area and the largest ECSA among the three samples. This behavior aligns with previous reports where catalysts with moderate BET surface areas but optimized nanostructures, e.g., Fe-LNO and HCSNi,56,57 exhibit exceptional ECSA. The Cdl values of the catalysts in 1 M KOH solutions were also determined. The resulting values were compared with ACS Catalysis pubs.acs.orgacscatalysis Research Article https:doi.org10.1021acscatal.4c06137 ACS Catal. 2025, 15, 1059110600 10597 those obtained in 1 M KOH 0.1 M KA oil solutions, as shown in Figure 4b. Specifically, the Cdl of β-NiOH2NS exhibits an increase from 2.59 to 2.84 μF upon adding KA oil, suggesting that β-NiOH2NS shows superior adsorption for KA oil. The difference between the two Cdl values ΔCdl follows the sequence of β-NiOH2NS 0.25 μF α- NiOH2NR 0.17 μF α-NiOH2NS 0.02 μF, indicating the variations in the adsorption capacity of KA oil over the three catalysts, which is consistent with the findings from the OCP tests. Moreover, capacitive measurements were applied to explore the adsorption of KA oil over the catalysts. The adsorption of KA oil onto the catalyst surface would modify the structures of the electric double layer, which in turn leads to variations in the interfacial capacitance.24 As illustrated in Figure S13, both β-NiOH2NS and α-NiOH2NR exhibit notable reductions in capacitance upon the addition of KA oil. In contrast, the capacitance of α-NiOH2NS shows the smallest change, demonstrating that among the three samples, α-NiOH2NS displays the lowest adsorption capacity for KA oil. To reveal the active sites of the as-synthesized samples for the electro-oxidation of KA oil, operando electrochemical Raman spectroscopy was employed Figure 4di. In 1 M KOH solutions, the Raman spectrum of α-NiOH2NR recorded at 1.63 V displays two weak peaks centered at ca. 487.5 and 562.7 cm1, which are attributed to Ni3-O bending and stretching vibrations, respectively,29,5860 as evidenced in Figure 4d. In 1 M KOH 0.1 M KA oil electrolyte, the formation of NiOOH occurs at 1.43 V, as confirmed by the appearance of two characteristic peaks at ca. 479.8 and 556.4 cm1 see Figure 4g. α-NiOH2NR exhibits a lower potential for the formation of NiOOH in the presence of KA oil, suggesting that KA oil significantly facilitates the reconstruction of α-NiOH2NR. Notably, vigorous bubble generation was observed at the potentials exceeding 1.63 V, blocking the objective lens and consequently resulting in the disappearance of Raman peaks.34 The Raman spectra of α- NiOH2NS were collected at varying potentials as shown in Figure 4e,h. The absence of Raman signals related to Ni3-O bending and stretching vibrations indicates that Ni2 oxidation in α-NiOH2NS is difficult, aligning with the LSV data. As shown in Figure 4f, β-NiOH2NS requires a lower applied potential 1.53 V to form NiOOH in 1 M KOH solutions compared",

As shown in Figure 4f, β-NiOH2NS requires a lower applied potential 1.53 V to form NiOOH in 1 M KOH solutions compared with α-NiOH2NR. In contrast, in the presence of KA oil, NiOOH formation occurred at a higher potential 1.63 V, likely due to the excellent adsorption of β-NiOH2NS for KA oil.26,47,61 To further investigate the KA oil electro-oxidation kinetics and interfacial behaviors, operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy EIS measurements were conducted.27 Figure S14 shows the Bode plots recorded in 1 M KOH 0.1 M KA oil solutions. The high-frequency response 101105 Hz is typically associated with the processes taking place in the inner electrode,62 including the electro-oxidation of the catalyst surface. The low-frequency region 102101 Hz reflects the nonhomogeneous charge distribution, such as the appearance of surface-adsorbed species at the interface.27 The Bode plots of the samples exhibit a characteristic peak at ca. 1 Hz, emerging at 1.23 V, showing a negative phase shift with increasing applied potential. On the basis of LSV results, this peak is ascribed to the adsorption of OH.35 Subsequently, characteristic peaks appear in the direction of higher phase angles, which is related to the oxidation of the KA oil. Specifically, the potentials of KA oxidation of α-NiOH2NR 1.53 V, α-NiOH2NS 1.49 V, and β-NiOH2NS 1.47 V are shown in Figure S15, corresponding to their respective KA oil oxidation peaks at 1.56, 1.53, and 1.52 V in the CV curves see Figure 2ac. According to the report of Bender et al., there are two pathways, namely, direct oxidation and indirect oxidation mechanisms for KA oxidation by NiOH2.61 The detailed mechanism of KA oxidation is closely related to the valence state of the nickel species. To address this issue, the potentials of NiOOH formation determined from operando electro- chemical Raman spectra see Figure 4gi are compared with those of KA oil oxidation derived from operando EIS see Figure S14, and CV results see Figure 2ac, as shown in Figure S15. The oxidation of KA oil by α-NiOH2NR occurred after the formation of NiOOH species, indicating an indirect oxidation pathway. No Raman signals related to the formation of active NiOOH intermediates were detected from α-NiOH2NS in 1 M KOH 0.1 M KA oil solutions, indicating that the oxidation of KA oil by α-NiOH2NS could follow a direct oxidation pathway. In contrast, the oxidation of KA oil by the β-NiOH2NS sample preceded the formation of NiOOH, suggesting that the oxidation process could possibly involve both direct and indirect oxidation mechanisms. 4. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, three NiOH2 samples, including α-NiOH2 NR, β-NiOH2NS, and α-NiOH2NS, with well-defined morphology and crystal structures were evaluated for electro- chemical conversion of KA oil. α-NiOH2NR had the best electrochemical activity, with a maximum current density of 17.6 mA mg1 at 1.57 V, which was significantly higher than those of β-NiOH2NS and α-NiOH2NS.

This may be related to the fact that α-NiOH2NR exhibited a lower potential of 1.43 V for the formation of NiOOH as compared to those of β-NiOH2NS 1.63 V and α-NiOH2NS no Raman signals for Ni3-O in 1 M KOH 0.1 M KA oil solutions. HPLC analysis indicated that β-NiOH2NS exhibited the highest AA selectivity of 26 at 1.63 V. The superior AA selectivity of β-NiOH2NS could be attributed to the adsorptions of the substrates and intermediates. In contrast, α-NiOH2NS showed poor electrochemical activity and product selectivity. OCP and Cdl measurements demonstrated that the adsorption capacity of KA oil over the three samples followed the sequence of β-NiOH2NS α- NiOH2NR α-NiOH2NS. Furthermore, operando Raman and EIS results suggest that the oxidation of KA oil by α-NiOH2NR mainly follows the indirect oxidation pathway, while the oxidation of KA oil by α-NiOH2NS follows the direct oxidation pathway. For β-NiOH2NS, both direct and indirect oxidation of KA oil takes place. This work clearly revealed the effects of structural features of NiOH2 on the electrochemical conversion of KA oil, which could be of significance for fabricating advanced catalysts for the oxidation of KA oil.

The in-situ generated HBr from substrate oxidation, known to be detrimental to the reaction itself, was perfectly consumed by cathode reduction. Challenges of this process include the difficulty in maintaining the synergy between substrate oxidation and cathode reduction as well as the general incompatibility of a hydrogen bonding catalytic system with the aqueous acidic media. A monophasic system was initially developed, but with little substrate generality. Further analysis of the mechanism and careful optimization allowed the development of a much more general and robust biphasic system that exhibited multiple advantages over chemical oxidation, including broader scope, less waste, milder conditions, and better enantioselectivity. It is also the first demonstration of chiral phosphoric acid catalysis in cooperation with H3PO4 in acidic aqueous media. Introduction Since the pioneering studies by Akiyama and Terada in 2004,1 chiral phosphoric acids CPA have evolved as a family of broadly powerful catalysts for diverse organic reactions.2 They have been employed as effective chiral ligands, hydrogen-bond donors, and sources of chiral counter anions. Their extraordinary ability in achieving outstanding asymmetric induction by weak interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, constitutes the key to success. While the design of sophisticated structures of CPAs contributed significantly to their performance, the choice of suitable reaction media often makes a big difference.",

Their extraordinary ability in achieving outstanding asymmetric induction by weak interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, constitutes the key to success. While the design of sophisticated structures of CPAs contributed significantly to their performance, the choice of suitable reaction media often makes a big difference. CPA-based hydrogen- bonding catalysis is typically implemented in non-polar aprotic solvents to minimize their competing and often detrimental influence. Moreover, other hydrogen-bond donors, such as stronger Brønsted acids, are typically incompatible with CPA catalysis. As a result, it is a formidable challenge to implement CPA-based hydrogen-bonding catalysis in polar protic solvents in the presence of a strong inorganic acid. In the meanwhile, asymmetric electrosynthesis has gained tremendous developments in the past few years.3-7 The conventional use of stoichiometric oxidants and reductants can be potentially replaced by electricity as a greener and more sustainable alternative. However, current success has been mainly in transition metal catalysis domain, which rely on relatively more robust interaction between chiral catalyst and substrate Scheme 1a.3,4 In contrast, asymmetric induction by weak interactions with a chiral organocatalyst in an electrochemical system has met with limited success, partly due to the challenges associated with those unavoidable polar species present in the media, such as electrolytes, that may interfere with the weak but Scheme 1.

The synergistic cooperation with inorganic phosphoric acid H3PO4 to achieve high efficiency and enantiocontrol was also demonstrated for the first time. Oxidative rearrangement of indoles to spirooxindoles was chosen as a model reaction for our study, as it represents an important process that converts readily available substrates to highly valuable complex biologically active molecules.8-10 Although great process has been achieved in the development and application of this process in the past few decades, there still remains very limited success in developing a catalytic enantioselective variant Scheme 1b.

Moreover, previous asymmetric protocols uniformly required the use of stoichiometric chemical oxidants.9,10 In this context, the advantages of electrosynthesis further inspired us to develop a greener and more sustainable approach by electrochemical oxidation. Results and Discussion It has been well-known that electrochemical oxidation of Br can be employed to replace chemical oxidants, such as Br2.3,7,11,12 To prove the feasibility of green oxidation approach, we first examined this enantioselective process with stoichiometric Br2 as oxidant and mixed THFH2O as solvent to mimic the electrochemical condition Scheme 2. With A1 structure shown in Table 1 as the catalyst, the reaction of 1a successfully generated the desired product 2a in quantitative yield, but with essentially no enantioselectivity, no matter with Br2 or its analogue nBu4NBr3 entries 12. We also tried slow addition of oxidant, but with no significant improvement entry 3. Next, a control experiment in the absence of A1 showed similar results, suggesting a strong background reaction that might explain the low enantiocontrol entry 4. From the proposed mechanism of this process,10 it is clear that two equivalents of HBr can be generated from this system, which may outcompete CPA to facilitate this process and cause low enantiocontrol. We were also curious about the absence of such dramatic influence of HI generated from the use of NIS in the chemical oxidation protocol.10 Indeed, control experiment indicated that NIS could oxidize HI into I2, thus avoiding the influence of the generated HI see the SI for details. Nevertheless, despite the discouraging chemical oxidation results, we reasoned that an electrochemical oxidation system may fix the problem caused by the generated acid HBr, as the anodic oxidation is accompanied by cathodic reduction, which converts H to H2 and thus neutralizes the reaction system Scheme 2, blue box. To test this hypothesis, we did preliminary study using electricity as oxidant. Gratifyingly, the enantioselectivity was significantly enhanced 73 ee, entry 5. A control reaction by the addition of two equivalents of HBr to this system led to almost complete loss of enantiocontrol entry 6, thus consistent with the above analysis on the influence of HBr in the chemical oxidation. Overall, the preliminary study clearly highlighted the advantage of electrochemical system for this process by synergizing the two half reactions in electrodes. The above preliminary outcome using A1 as catalyst, nBu4NBr as both electrolyte and mediator, and THFH2O as solvent was used as a starting point for further optimization Table 1, entry 1. Variation of the anode material to graphite felt GF, glassy carbon GC or carbon rod CR resulted in decreased yield and ee entries 2. However, almost same results were observed with nickel as cathode entry 3. Other CPAs were also examined.

However, acetone gave comparable results with THF entry 11, and more importantly, it led to higher conductivity, so it was employed for further study.

With the optimized protocol, we started to explore the reaction scope. However, to our surprise, this protocol was not general at all. For example, variation of the electronic properties on the indole ring had a drastic influence on reactivity. Substrates 1h and 1k showed completely no reactivity under the above conditions Scheme 3. We reasoned that this might be due to unbalanced synergy between substrate oxidation and cathodic reduction. In the ideal situation, the indole oxidation should not be slower than cathodic reduction krxn kred, thus the whole system is slightly acidic and the generated HBr is reduced in cathode. However, if this balance is broken e.g., krxn kred, there is insufficient HBr generated for cathodic reduction. Consequently, to maintain electron balance, water would be reduced instead, which generates hydroxide OH and turns the system into alkaline. The generated hydroxide",

Consequently, to maintain electron balance, water would be reduced instead, which generates hydroxide OH and turns the system into alkaline. The generated hydroxide not only quenches the CPA catalyst, but also further causes consumption of Br2 by forming BrO, which shuts down the indole oxidation. In principle, such an issue might be alleviated by adjusting the current. However, it is tedious to tune these parameters for each substrate. Thus, a more general protocol applicable to all the substrates would be highly desirable. Scheme 3. Preliminary examination of substrate generality and analysis. We envisioned that a biphasic system allowing physical separation of the indole oxidation and cathodic reduction might be a possible solution to the above issue Table 2. We then employed a mixture of DCM and H2O as solvent. NaBr was chosen as a source of bromide and electrolyte as well, since it has a good solubility in aqueous phase. Unfortunately, the results were irreproducible entry 1, suggesting partial water reduction in the cathode might be still involved to cause an unstable pH value of the system. In this context, we reasoned that the addition of an external acid should ensure an acidic medium, despite its possible interference with CPA in asymmetric induction. Thus, various Brønsted acids of different strengths were examined, including weak acid AcOH and strong inorganic acids HCl, H2SO4, and H3PO4. Among them, HCl and H2SO4 showed neither obvious improvement nor negative effect entries 23. However, AcOH was able to improve the enantioselectivity 93 ee, but with almost no increase in yield entry 4. To our delight, H3PO4 proved superior, resulting in both excellent yield and enantioselectivity entry 5. Moreover, the results were reproducible, with either one or two equivalents of loading entry 6. We believe that the ability of H3PO4, together with its conjugate bases, to serve as a potential buffer to stabilize the acidity of the reaction system might contribute to its extraordinary performance. Furthermore, to briefly test the generality, 1h and 1k were subjected to this new protocol. Both resulted in excellent efficiency and enantioselectivity entries 78, thereby illustrating improved generality of this biphasic binary acid system. It is also worth noting that, to the best of our knowledge, the combined use of CPA and H3PO4 for effective enantioselective catalysis has not been demonstrated before.2 Table 2.

With the newly optimized biphasic protocol, we next examined a wide range of different indole substrates for the enantioselective electrochemical oxidative rearrangement Scheme 4. These reactions were smoothly enlarged to 0.3-mmol scale, along with a higher electric current of 9 mA. Different protecting groups on the nitrogen of the tetrahydro-β-carbolines, such as Boc, Fmoc, Cbz, Bz, and Ts, were all well-tolerated under the mild conditions 2a2e. Moreover, various substituents at different 4- to 7- positions of the indole ring, including both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing ones, all led to excellent outcomes 2f2p. It is worth noting that simple deprotection of 2h could generate the natural alkaloid horsfiline with ease.13 This electrochemical system has a number of advantages over our previously reported chemical oxidation protocol.10 Other than the use of green electricity, the new conditions showed a broader substrates scope. For example, substrates bearing a C4- or C7-substituent e.g., 2f, 2o2p were unsuccessful before, but they reacted smoothly to provide the desired products with excellent enantioselectivity and efficiency under the present electrochemical system. Moreover, tetrahydrofuranyl-sprooxindole 2q, representing another important family of substructures,14 could also be easily synthesized with high enantiopurity. In contrast, such molecules were obtained with sub-optimal enantiocontrol under the previous chemical oxidation system.10 Of note, the previous chemical oxidation system strictly required careful operation at low temperature to achieve high enantioselectivity, but the new electrochemical condition worked efficiently at ambient temperature. Finally, the monophasic system could also be applied to indoles without ring fusion in the 2,3-positions, leading to the corresponding oxindoles 2r2u bearing a non-spiro all- carbon quaternary stereocenter.15 However, a 2-aryl-substituted indole may form the 3-brominated imine product, which was unreactive toward further rearrangement see more details in the SI. Importantly, a gram-scale synthesis of 2h with a reduced catalyst loading resulted in equally high yield and enantioselectivity, illustrating the practicability of this electrochemical process. It is also worth mentioning that all these examples demonstrated exceptionally high Faradaic efficiency, mostly exceeding 80. Scheme 4.

In the monophasic system, substrate 1a showed higher oxidation potential than nBu4NBr, suggesting the indole oxidation was performed indirectly by the in-situ generated oxidant from bromide Figure 1a. Upon mixing with 1a, the solution of nBu4NBr exhibited a catalytic current, suggesting consumption of the intermediary oxidant e.g., Br2 by reacting with 1a. For the biphasic system, we examined the effect of additives Figure 1b. The addition of H3PO4 had no influence on the cyclic voltammetry curve of NaBr. In contrast, the addition of NaOH caused an obvious change featuring a higher oxidation current, which might be due to the consumption of the generated Br2 by NaOH. Control experiments were also performed to probe the role of bromide Figure 1c. Replacing NaBr with NaNO3, an alternative electrolyte, led to no reaction. However, the addition of a catalytic amount of NaBr to this system restored the reactivity. These observations implied that NaBr not only served as an electrolyte, but also a mediator, which was consistent with our proposed mechanism involving Br2 as oxidant. Notably, increasing the NaBr concentration did not lead to further improvement see more details in the SI. Then we investigated the role of H3PO4. Two electrolysis reactions of 1a were performed in parallel, with and without H3PO4, under otherwise identical standard conditions Figure 1d. In the absence of H3PO4, the pH value of the aqueous phase increased obviously over time. In the meanwhile, the product enantioselectivity was mediocre and unstable. In contrast, with H3PO4, the same reaction showed almost constant pH value. resulting the inferior and unstable enantioselectivity. While in the presence of H3PO4, the pH value of the aqueous phase remained almost no change before reaction completion. Moreover, the product ee value was also constant and excellent. These observations undoubtedly confirmed the role of H3PO4 as a buffer to stabilize the acidity of the reaction system, which was crucial to the excellent outcome.16 Based on the above results, a possible mechanism is proposed Figure 1e. The reaction begins by anodic oxidation of the bromide in the aqueous phase. The resulting Br2 enters the organic phase to oxidize the substrate with the CPA",

Mechanistic studies. Conclusion In summary, we have developed the first catalytic enantioselective electrochemical oxidative rearrangement of indoles, leading to green and efficient synthesis of diverse highly enantioenriched spirooxindoles. The synergy between indole oxidation and cathode reduction proved critical to the success. The in-situ generated HBr from oxidative rearrangement proved to be detrimental to the reaction itself, but it can be perfectly consumed by cathode reduction. However, the initially developed monophasic system could not maintain this delicate balance of reaction rates, thus lacking generality. Nevertheless, careful mechanism analysis and condition optimization led to a successful improvement into a much more general biphasic 10.1002anie.202510078 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

This new protocol exhibited multiple advantages over the previous chemical oxidation approach, including less waste, broader scope, and milder conditions. The choice of H3PO4 as an additive not only ensured good reproducibility and robustness of this protocol but also improved the chemical efficiency and enantioselectivity. This is also the first demonstration of CPA catalysis in cooperation with H3PO4 in aqueous media. The unusual enhancement in performance by H3PO4 could be explained by the formation of a hypothetical heterodimer with CPA. Mechanistic and control experiments confirmed that NaBr served as both electrolyte and mediator. The development of other organocatalytic enantioselective electrosynthesis methods by weak interactions is ongoing in our laboratories.

Here, we reform the waterion networks via electrolyte concentration manipulation and electrode construction on atomically flat Au single-crystal surfaces. With the combination of in situ Raman spectroscopy and multifidelity theoretical simulations, we pinpoint H2O with dual hydrogen-bond donors as an observable indicator for nitrate electroreduction NO3RR. A hierarchical configuration characterized by structured Li NO3 planes coupled with enriched hydrogen-bond networks is verified to streamline the reactive intermediates activation and proton transport, thus synergistically boosting NO3RR. We highlight the cooperative modulation of the interfacial waterion interactions and the hydrogen-bond networks in optimizing NO3RR. Our findings unveil microscale viewpoint of synergy between the local ionwater interactions and connectivity of the hydrogen-bonding network. INTRODUCTION As a vanguard of green energy and a pillar of sustainable agriculture, ammonia NH3 stimulates continuous progress in farming, plastics, and chemical industries, epitomizing the intersection where sustainable oversight harmonizes with productive industry.1 The electrochemical reduction of nitrate NO3 promises not only to reinvent sustainable fabrication techniques but also to address the problem of NO3 pollution, which compromises aquatic ecosystems and challenges global nitrogen cycle.2 In the realm of nitrate reduction reaction NO3RR, a delicate balance must be reached and it requires precise modulation to ensure it donates adequate protons for the hydrogenation reaction, meanwhile avoiding engagement in the undesired hydrogen evolution reaction HER.3 This subtle control over the role of interfacial water is pivotal for optimizing the efficiency and selectivity of the NO3RR.4 To decode the mechanism of interfacial electrocatalytic reactions, comprehensive insight into the microstructure structure of the solidliquid interface is imperative. The evolving electric double layer EDL structure inspires accurate depictions of the configuration and connectivity of interfacial hydrogen-bond networks and waterion networks under bias potentials.5,6 The intricate hydrogen-bond networks at interfaces serve as the underlying microscopic origin for the kinetics of electrochemical processes, profoundly impacting the energy conversion efficiency. Ions induce significant perturba- tion to the hydrogen-bond network of interfacial water, critically shaping the characteristics of EDLs. On the one hand, the molecular insights into the dynamics of an electrocatalytic process are rooted in the organization of waterion networks at the interface.7 Notably, the waterion interactions can directly facilitate the activation of reactive species and initiate the reaction, as elucidated in previous work that accumulation of cations at the interface can induce ordered interfacial water structures and accelerate the water dissociation.8 On the other hand, the hydrogen-bond network of interfacial water plays a vital role in proton transfer, a well- recognized key factor influencing the sustainability of the reaction.9 Significantly, these",

In tandem with recognition of the indispensability of high- performance catalysts of the NO3RR, knowledge deficits still exist regarding active phases and reaction kinetics at reconstructed surfaces. Considering the profound impact of the solidelectrolyte interface takes center stage, the properties of electrolyte encompassing cations, anions, H2O content, electrolyte concentration, and pH significantly govern the kinetics of electrocatalytic NO3RR.10,11 Although precise Received: February 13, 2025 Revised: May 30, 2025 Accepted: June 2, 2025 Article pubs.acs.orgJACS XXXX American Chemical Society A https:doi.org10.1021jacs.5c02540 J.

Real-time description of hydrogen- bond networks, distribution, and interactions of ions are essential yet hard to achieve, especially at extreme potentials and high concentrations. Considerable theoretical and experimental efforts have been devoted to achieving a microscopic understanding of ion solvation and hydrogen- bond environments of waterion networks. The characteristics of the cations, such as size and the hydration, have a significant effect on various electrochemical reactions.12,13 Anions in the electrolyte modulate microenvironments proximal to the catalyst surface and affect product distribution, especially when particularly when they serve as primary reactants in interfacial processes such as the electroreduction of NO3 and the formation of a solid electrolyte interface SEI in alkali- metal-ion batteries.14 Recent investigations have unveiled that anions actively engage in the interfacial hydrogen-bond networks, with their decomposition notably promoted in high concentration electrolytes.15 Despite significant advance- ments, the precise architecture of anions, their interplay with cations and water at interfaces, and their fundamental function in governing interfacial reactivity remain enigmatic, remaining a topic of ongoing doubt. Daunting questions for experimental investigation of the EDL structure principally lie in the intricate interplay of interactions and the dynamic evolution of waterion net- works.16 However, harsh electrochemical conditions compli- cate the understanding of interfacial dynamics due to complex waterion interactions and hydrogen-bond fluctuations. As an advanced analytical technique with exceptional surface sensitivity, shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spec- troscopy SHINERS overcomes the material and morpho- logical limitations of conventional surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy SERS and effectively utilized to decipher EDL configurations under specialized scenarios.17,18 In this article, we delve into the interfacial water structure and the reduction dynamics of anions in LiNO3 aqueous electrolytes across varying concentrations on atomically ordered and stable Au",

Au single- crystal surfaces were selected as an ideal platform for probing the structureactivity correlation between interfacial water ion network dynamics and NO3RR activity, leveraging their optimal NO2 adsorption, and inherent suppression of competing hydrogen evolution, which collectively govern selective NH3 formation. Specifically, we note that the ordered LiNO3 planes, with NO3 lying flat against the electrode surface, promotes the activation of adsorbed NO3 under high electrolyte concentrations. Moreover, the hydrogen bonds formed between out-plane NO3 and H2O significantly enrich hydrogen-bond networks at the interface and further accelerate NO3RR. Notably, through modulating the crystallographic orientation and electronic structure of the electrode, the NO3RR was further enhanced by rational constructing the interfacial waterion networks. Our findings suggest that strategically modulating waterion interactions and the Figure 1. Solvation structures of LiNO3 solutions. A OH stretching band of bulk LiNO3 solutions and pure water.

XXXX, XXX, XXXXXX B connectivity of hydrogen-bond networks is a groundbreaking approach to engineer the intricate landscapes of interfacial water environments. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Solvation Structure of LiNO3 Solutions. The LiNO3 solutions across a wide range of molar ratios of LiNO3 to H2O 1:555 to 1:2.5 were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, as shown in Figures 1A and S3. As the concentration of LiNO3 increases, the structure of water in the solution undergoes significant changes and the OH vibration modes of water molecules, which are highly sensitive to the organization of water and intermolecular interactions, provide valuable insight into this transition. As the concentration increases, the width of the OH stretching vibration peak progressively narrows, accompanied by a decrease in its intensity, indicating the formation of more structured water networks. Additionally, the blue-shift of the OH stretching vibration suggests a strengthening of the OH bond, implying a higher energy requirement for bond disruption and a weakening of the hydrogen-bond network. The Raman profile of the hydrate crystal LixH2O is shown in Figure S4 and its OH band deconvolved into four components Figure 1B, specifically, 3286 cm1, 3374 cm1, 3490 cm1, and 3545 cm1. These spectral features are indicative of a polymer-like chain, which is enveloped by nitrate ions through electrostatic interactions. This crystal structure forms a critical foundation for deducing the arrangement in superconcentrated LiNO3 solutions.19 The structure of this crystal serves as a significant basis for inferring the structure of superconcentrated LiNO3 solution.

This crystal structure forms a critical foundation for deducing the arrangement in superconcentrated LiNO3 solutions.19 The structure of this crystal serves as a significant basis for inferring the structure of superconcentrated LiNO3 solution. The Raman data demonstrate the transition of the water molecule structure from isolated units to clusters, ultimately forming a polymer-like chain, as visualized in the inset scheme in Figure 1B. The concentration dependence of the chemical shift, observed through proton nuclear magnetic resonance 1H NMR spectroscopy at varying LiNO3 concentrations, is illustrated in Supporting Information Figure S5 and their 1H chemical shift are shown in Figure 1C. From 1:555 to 1:4, the 1H signal of water molecules progressively shifts from 4.84 to 4.68 ppm. This shift is attributed to a decrease in electron density near the protons, resulting from amplified long- distance interactions between water molecules, signaling the formation of larger water networks. Intriguingly, at higher concentrations, the 1H signal shifts further upfield, indicating a reduction in hydrogen bond density and an increase in LiOH water oxygen interactions. To further correlate the water structure with electrochemical activity, steady-state polar- ization curves were recorded and are presented in Figure 1D. As the concentration increases, the onset potential of the overall reduction reaction shifts positively, indicating enhanced interfacial reduction activity. These findings suggest that the dominant mechanism governing the interfacial activity extends beyond the influence of ionwater interactions in bulk solutions. Instead, the critical role of the water network at the interface warrants further investigation. In Situ Probing of the EDL Structures.

Through a combined approach employing Gaussian fitting methodology and theoretical simulations Figures S18S23, we identified three distinct components within the OH stretching band of interfacial water based on the donor number of hydrogen bonds,20 specifically, H2O with 2 donors H2ON2 around 32003300 cm1, H2O with 1 donor H2ON1 around 33003500 cm1, and H2O without any donor H2ON0 above 3500 cm1.

The potential- dependent proportion change of each component is quantified and illustrated in Figure 2B by columns. Notably, the population of H2ON2 and H2ON0 increases evidently with the negative going potential, while that of H2ON1 decreases, consistent with the results of classical molecular dynamics simulations, as indicated by the dotted lines. The observed increase in H2ON0, predominantly comprised cation-coordinated water LiH2O, which could be attributed to the electrostatic attraction exerted by the negatively charged electrode.21 Intriguingly, the rise in the H2ON2 population contradicts the conventional cation-dominated paradigm, where accumulated cations at negative potentials typically disrupt the hydrogen-bond network, leading to a more structured interfacial water layer. The anomalous rise in H2ON2 may stem from the interactions between H2O and NO3 , which is influenced by the hydrogen bond affinity of NO3 . In situ Raman experiments conducted with 1:11 LiClO4 Figure S7 and LiCl Figure S8 further support this interpretation, as evidenced by the decrease of H2ON2 with increasingly negative potentials. These differences arise from the structural diversity of anions and their varied interactions with H2O. The NO3 can be safely regarded as hydrophilic, whereas ClO4 and Clown slightly hydrophobic nature, as confirmed by previous studies.22,23 The observed increase in H2ON2 populations at negative potentials arises from the unique dual role of NO3 as a hydrogen-bond acceptor and a structural linker. This anomaly reflects nitrates ability to form LiNO3 H2O coordination clusters under interfacial electric fields, which reorganize water networks into dense H-bonded configurations. The involvement of NO3 in the EDL significantly alters the characteristics of the interfacial hydrogen-bond networks, which also triggers its own electro- chemical conversion. To further investigate the electrochemical behavior, linear sweep voltammetry LSV experiments were carried out in 1:11 LiNO3, NaNO3, and NaClO4 electrolytes. The results showed an early onset potential and an increase in the reduction current, indicating the presence of an additional reduction process in the NO3 -containing electrolytes Figure S2A. Gas chromatography GC measurements were subsequently utilized Figures 2C and S14 to evaluate the NO3RR.24 The formation of nitrite NO2 results directly from the detachment of oxygen from NO3 , whereas NH3 represents a product of an eight-electron reduction.

This observation further indicates that the conversion of NO3 to NO2 constitutes the rate-determining step in synthesizing NH3 from NO3 on transition metals, consistent with prior studies.25 Atomic Insights of EDL Structures. Multifidelity MD simulations were employed to further rationalize the atomic- level structure of the EDL structure at the 1:11 Au111 LiNO3 interface Figure S18. The lithium density profile Figure 3A reveals a pronounced enrichment of Li as the potential becomes more negative. Remarkably, NO3 demon- strates a pronounced double-peak distribution close to the surface Figure 3A. The complex interplay of forces from negatively charged Au and accumulated Li contributes to the constant intensity of NO3 closest to the interface and they are predominantly coordinated with three Li ions Figure 3B. The 3LiNO3 planes are nearly parallel to the interface, as evidenced by calculated angles between the normal NO3 plane and the Au111 interface Figure 3C. The N atom in 3LiNO3 of the first peak is positioned closer to the interface Figures 3B and S28, facilitating charge exchange with the electrode. Furthermore, the coordination of Li with the oxygen of NO3 results in elongation of the NO bond Figure S29, thereby promoting the activation of NO3 NO3 NO2 O. The slow growth method was applied to quantificationally calculate the activation ability of oxygen in NO3 Figure 3D, revealing that Li coordination significantly lowers the activation energy of oxygen.26 Thus, the 3LiNO3 complex exhibits the highest activity due to the coordination of its three oxygen atoms with Li. Regarding the second peak associated with NO3 anions, its intensity is observed to increase as the potential shifts negative. This enhancement is attributed to the predominance of the attractive force exerted by lithium ions on NO3 , which adopts a configuration that is more perpendicular to the interface Figure S26 and exhibits reduced interaction with Li Figure S27. Consequently, the intensification of NO3 in the second layer is responsible for the growing population of H2ON2, owing to the inherent capacity of unbound NO3 to serve as a hydrogen-bond acceptors. For further confirmation, we quantified the instances of NO3 as hydrogen-bonds acceptors Figure 3E, and the analysis indicated that more hydrogen bonds",

The strengthened connectivity of the hydrogen-bond networks facilitates proton transfer to the interface,27,28 which is essential for the conversion of NO2 to ammonia via proton-coupled electron transfer steps. Figure 3F encapsulates the atomic bilayer EDL structure at the 1:11 Au111LiNO3 interface, illustrating both the NO3 activation process and hydrogen bond enrichment. In this scenario, the nitrite yield rate and the population of H2ON2 are proposed to mirror the ammonia yield rate.

Notably, the H2ON2 population and yield rates of the products exhibited a volcanic-like dependence on concentration with a maximum of 1:11 LiNO3 Figures 4A and S15. The interplay between NO3 and interfacial hydrogen-bond networks, alongside the reduction behavior, underscores a distinct structurefunction relationship within the EDL. Variations in the H2ON2 population with bias potential were analyzed in both diluted and superconcentrated solutions, as illustrated in Figure 4B,C, respectively. In diluted electrolytes, the limited availability of LiNO3 in the bulk solution restricts the presence of both Li and NO3 at the interface. This scarcity results in a more inclined configuration to interact with H2O at relatively positive potentials Figure S31, thereby impeding the activation of NO3 . Concurrently, although unbound NO3 can enhance the hydrogen-bond network of interfacial water, the Li ions dominate the hydrogen-bond networks due to their propensity to aggregate near the interface inset in Figure 4B. Consequently, this results in a decreasing trend in H2ON2 at less negative potentials. In contrast, at a highly negative potential, the electric field draws an abundance of Li and NO3 to the interface, facilitating the formation of a distinct NO3 bilayer. This leads to an increase in the H2ON2 population, thus boosting the NO3RR efficiency. In more concentrated electrolyte solutions, a less negative potential is required to organize the NO3 bilayer and more H2ON2 is formed correspondently, correlating with enhanced efficiency in NO3RR. However, at excessively high concentrations, a",

In more concentrated electrolyte solutions, a less negative potential is required to organize the NO3 bilayer and more H2ON2 is formed correspondently, correlating with enhanced efficiency in NO3RR. However, at excessively high concentrations, a significant decrease in the number of water molecules was observed alongside a considerable enrichment of Li ions at the interface. This leads to the phenomenon that nearly all of the oxygen atoms of interfacial NO3 are coordinated with Li, rendering them incapable of forming hydrogen bonds with water molecules the insets are shown in Figures 4C and S32. The weak interaction between the NO3 and water molecules results in less connected hydrogen-bond networks within the EDL. In the context of superconcentrated LiNO3, which exhibits a polymer-like structure Figure S4,19 the formation of stable LiH2O2n chain maintains a constant population of H2ON2 population, with minimal variation with changes in potential. The reduction of NO3 is thus impeded in superconcentrated Au111LiNO3 on account of structural obstacles and a scarcity of available H2O. A schematic of the concentration-dependent interfacial solvation structure on Au111LiNO3 is shown in Figure 4D. The crystallographic orientation and electronic structure of the electrode significantly impact the interfacial waterion networks. We further monitored the NO3RR efficiency by tuning the waterion network through varying the crystallo- graphic orientations of Au single-crystal surfaces Figures S10, S11. The product Figures 5A and S16 yield rates follow the order Au111 Au110 Au100, sharing a similar trend with the corresponding H2ON2 population. The more positive point of zero charge PZC indicates a higher surface charge density on the Au111 surface, thereby facilitating the organization of the interfacial bilayer structure.29 The surface structure thus directly impacts the formation of an efficient EDL, highlighting the critical role of crystallographic orientation in the design of electrocatalytic interfaces. Building on these findings, we designed a heterostructure by spontaneously adsorbing Sn onto the Au111 surface to further enhance the nitrate reduction activity. The Au111-Sn demonstrated superior NH3 and NO2 yield rate Figures 5A, S2B, S16 and S17, alongside the highest proportion of H2ON2 Figure S12, which could be attributed to the suppression of the competing HER by Sn.30 The hetero- structure design of Au111-Sn underscores the importance of combining different materials to leverage synergistic effects, where Sn acts to optimize the interfacial waterion networks and further enhances the catalytic performance shown in Figure 5B. The activation energy for dissociation of NO3 with Li-coordinated oxygen on Au111-Sn was calculated by AIMD Figure S33. The activation energy decreases to 0.96 eV on Au111-Sn, revealing Sn-induced electron redistrib- ution facilitates nitrate adsorption and activation. These findings indicate that the EDL structures share similarities at these electrodes, and the variance in the electrocatalytic performance is primarily derived from the efficiency in orchestrating the bilayer structure, as evidenced by H2ON2 populations.

Introduction Ammonia NH3 plays an extremely important role in modern society, which is the raw material for the manufacture of nitrogen fertilizer, nitrogen-containing medicines, polymer materials, dyes and so on.13 The global annual ammonia production has reached 235 million tons in 2019.4 Up to now, industrial ammonia synthesis heavily relies on the century-old Haber-Bosch process, in which nitrogen N2 and hydrogen H2 are reacted to NH3 using Fe-base material as a catalyst at harsh conditions temperature 400500 C, pressure 150300 atm. Due to the harsh conditions and the huge ammonia production in the world, NH3 synthesis industry consumes about 1-2 of the global annual energy demand, accounting for about 1 of the carbon dioxide CO2 emission.5,6 Hence, it is very urgent to develop a green, sustainable and energy-saving ammonia synthesis technology to partially replace the Haber-Bosch process. Electricity driven nitrates reduction reaction NO3RR is regarded as a powerful complement to the traditional Haber-Bosch process toward large-scale ammonia synthesis. Benefitting from the extremely high solubility of the nitrate ions, and relative low bond energy of NO 204 kJ mol1, the ammonia generation kinetics of NO3RR is increased by 3-4 orders of magnitude with relatively low energy input in comparison to the fascinating nitrogen reduction reaction NRR.716 Moreover, nitrates are widely existed in nature, mainly derived from industrial wastewater, domestic sewage, livestock manure and nuclear industry wastewater.17 Beyond that, NO3RR possesses high equilibrium potential of 0.69 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode RHE, higher than that of the oxygen reduction reaction ORR, 0.4 V in Znairoxygen batteries.18,19 As such, integrating of NO3RR as a cathode coupled with zinc oxidation as an anode to assemble zinc-nitrate battery, can achieve the goal of one stone and three birds, namely the removal of nitrates, obtaining valuable ammonia and outputting electrical energy.2023 However, the current electrochemical NO3-to-NH3 conversion is still restricted by the low NH3 yield rate and Faradaic efficiency FE. 10.1002anie.202509303 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.",

See the Terms and Conditions https:onlinelibrary.wiley.comterms-and-conditions on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 4 Typically, NO3-to-NH3 conversion is a process involving nine protons and eight electrons NO3 9H 8eNH3 3H2O, in which the various N-intermediates undergo step-by-step hydrogenation and dehydration on the catalyst surface, ultimately convert to NH3. Currently, various strategies, including alloying,12,20 heteroatom doping,18 heterojunction,11,22 defect engineering23 have been put forward, aiming to reduce the energy barrier of the rate-determining step RDS of NO3RR.24 Nevertheless, the influence of the energy barriers of the non-RDSs in NO3RR on the overall performance was ignored. Inspired by the water flow process in nature, which always spontaneously experiences the lowest energy path, the overall NO3RR performance is bound to be optimal if each elementary step also undergoes the lowest energy barrier. For the multi-intermediates and multi-steps involved reduction process, multiple active centers nor single active center are essential to achieve the lowest energy barrier required for each conversion step as much as possible.25 Here, we put forward a novel continuous intermediates spillover strategy to enhance proton-coupled electron transfer process by constructing dual single-atom molybdenum Mo1 and iron Fe1 alloy metallene. Previous reports have confirmed that Mo and Fe single-atom sites could achieve the tandem NO3RR, which achieved high NH3 FE.26,27 In addition, the Pd metallene was chosen as the carrier due to the high specific surface area, tunable electronic structure, which endowed high electrochemical performance in catalysis.28 The atomically dispersed Mo and Fe atoms in Pd matrix facilitated N-intermediates hop back and forth between Mo and Fe sites in searching of the lower energy barrier for each elementary step, which was confirmed by in situ spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations. Beyond that, atomic Mo and Fe doping regulated the interfacial water network structure to inhibit the too fast water splitting kinetics, which synchronously guaranteed high NH3 yield rate and FE. As a result, the synthesized dual single-atom alloy metallene displayed greatly enhanced NH3 yield rate and NH3 FE compared with that of the counterpart metallenes. 10.1002anie.202509303 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

Carbon monoxide CO molecules in situ released from Fe2CO9 and MoCO6 adsorbed tightly on Pd-rich alloy surface, which resulted in the formation of ultrathin Pd-rich nanosheet, i.e., Pd-rich trimetallene, denotes as Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene.28 As a control, atomically dispersed iron Fe1Pd or molybdenum Mo1Pd atoms bimetallenes, and Pd metallene were synthesized with a similar synthetic process Figures S1 and S2. Powder X-ray diffraction XRD patterns show that both Mo1Fe1Pd and the control samples possess face-centered cubic fcc structure, consistent with that of fcc Pd JCPDS no. 46-1043, Figure 1b. As determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry ICP-MS, the molar ratios of Pd, Fe and Mo were 90:8:2. Transmission electron microscopy TEM and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM HAADF-STEM images reveal that the sample is dominated by ultrathin nanosheet structure Figures 1c and S1a with average lateral size of about 100-200 nm. The thickness of the trimetallene is only 1.8 nm, determined by atomic force microscopy AFM measurement Figure 1d, coincided with the result determined by TEM characterization the insert in Figure 1c, further confirming the metallene structure. Atomic-resolution aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM image Figure 1e displays clear two-dimensional atom arrangement with a lattice distance of 0.195 nm at the edge of the metallene, assigning to the 100 plane of Mo1Fe1Pd. EDS elemental mapping images in Figure 1f demonstrate the uniform distribution of Mo, Fe and Pd across the entire metallene, further verifying the trimetallic alloy structure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS result of Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene indicates that Mo 3d spectrum Figure 1g displays two pairs of peaks with binding energy located at 227.2, 229.7 eV and 232.5, 235.8 eV, assigning to 3d52 and 3d32 10.1002anie.202509303 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

MoPd 2.72 Å and MoFe 2.50 Å bonds were resolved in the first shell with a coordination number CN of 3.7 and 1.7, respectively. The fine structure was further confirmed by fitting the k3-weighted Fourier transformed EXAFS spectra and k space results Figures S4a and S5a. The results indicate that Mo atoms are atomically dispersed in PdFe alloy matrix. Figure 2c and 2d shows the Fe K-edge XANES and EXAFS spectra of Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene sample in comparison to Fe foil and FeO, respectively. Similar to Mo case, FeFe bonds were absent, and PdFe bond length 2.80 Å, CN 1.6 and FeO bonds bond length 1.96 Å, CN 3.1 were resolved. The results suggest that Fe is also atomically dispersed in PdMo alloy lattice. Notably, the existence of FeO bonds suggests Fe element was partially oxidized in the air, consistent with that of XPS results. The Fe fine structure was also verified by fitting the k3-weighted Fourier transformed EXAFS spectra and k space results Figures S4b and S5b. Pd K-edge XANES and EXAFS spectra Figures 2e, 2f, S4c, S5c resolve PdPd and PdMoFe bonds.

Putting together the above results, we conclude that Mo and Fe atoms are atomically dispersed in Pd-rich alloy lattice, namely dual single-atom Mo and Fe alloy. Electrochemical NO3RR performance of Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene was evaluated in an H-type cell using a typical three-electrode system at room temperature. Linear sweep voltammetry LSV tests were firstly performed in the mixture solution of KOH and KNO3 to assess the current response. As shown in Figure 3a, the onset potential for Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene is positively shifted from 0.32 Pd metallene, 0.43 Fe1Pd bimetallene, 0.48 Mo1Pd bimetallene to 0.55 V versus RHE, suggesting that Mo1Fe1Pd is more active in NO3RR. As expected, the current density in NO3RR of Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene is obvious higher than that of Mo1Pd, Fe1Pd bimetallenes, and Pd metallene.

The results indicate that alloying dual single-atom Mo and Fe in Pd lattice indeed strengthens NO3RR performance of Pd metallene. Notably, the synergistic effect of dual single-atom Mo and Fe atoms doping for NO3RR was confirmed by altering Mo and Fe contents in Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene Figures S6 and S7, and discussed in detail in the following section. Upon confirming the optimal Mo and Fe content, potential-dependent ammonia yield rates Figures 3b, S8 and ammonia FEs Figure 3c were obtained after electrolysis at the fixed potentials. Obviously, NH3 yield rates and NH3 FEs all gradually increased as the applied potentials negatively shifted from 0.1 to 0.7 V versus RHE for all the samples. Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene delivered much higher NH3 yield rates than that of Fe1Pd, Mo1Pd bimetallenes, and Pd metallene samples over the entire potential range. The maximum NH3 yield rate of Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene reached 13.4 mol gcat.1 h1 at 0.7 V, which was about 4.8- and 1.5-fold higher than that of Pd metallene 2.8 mol gcat.1 h1 and Fe1Pd bimetallene 9.1 mol gcat.1 h1, respectively. Consistent with the activity, NH3 FEs of Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene all surpassed Fe1Pd, Mo1Pd bimetallenes, and Pd metallene in the potential range of 0.1 to 0.7 V. Impressively, Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene delivered a high NH3 FE of 94.6 at 10.1002anie.202509303 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

To confirm the accuracy of the above NH3 quantitative results, the yielded NH3 in the electrolyte was further spectrographically quantified with indophenol blue assay, and the results are consistent Figure S12. In industrial scenarios, durability is an important parameter for catalyst assessment. In H-type cell, Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene could sustain continuous thirty cycles at 0.7 V, NH3 yield rates and NH3 FEs were stable without obvious activity decay Figure S13. To further assess the stability, the catalyst was further characterized by XRD pattern and TEM measurement after durability test. The crystal structure and the morphology of the Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene were well maintained Figure S14. EDS mapping images confirmed the uniform distribution of the elements, and XPS results revealed the valence states of the elements were well sustained, confirming the rigidity of the catalyst Figures S15 and S16.

Amazingly, Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene electrode could be stably operated at a total current density jtotal of about 225 mA for 300 h Figure 3d. In which, the yielded NH3 in the electrolyte showed a linear relationship with the electrolysis time. Finally, 0.32 mol NH3 was obtained after 300 h electrolysis with nitrate ions conversion of 64.0. More importantly, NH3 FEs were maintained above 80 during the entire device operation process. After the long-term of electrolysis, NH3 in the electrolyte was stripped out by bubbling Ar flow and collected downstream with a diluted HCl solution Figure S18.32 Finally, 9.36 g of high-purity of NH4Cl powder was obtained by evaporating the hydrochloric acid 10.1002anie.202509303 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene catalyst exceeds the current state-of-the-art Mo and Fe- based electrocatalysts as summarized in Figure 3f in terms of the onset potential, NH3 yield rate, NH3 FE, current density and service life Table S2. Then, 15N isotope labeling experiment was carried out to confirm that the produced NH3 was really rooted from NO3RR, not contamination from nitrogenous precursors Figure 3g. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum 1H-NMR of the electrolyte shows a double peak between 7.1-7.4 ppm with a coupling constant of 72 Hz using K15NO3 as N-resource, the characteristic signal of 15NH4.33 As a control, a triplet peak with a coupling constant of 52 Hz arise in 1H-NMR spectrum with K14NO3 as N-feeding. The above result irrefutably confirms the yielded NH3 indeed come from NO3RR. Moreover, Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene delivers excellent NO3RR performance in a wide range of NO3 concentrations Figure 3h and pH Figure S19. In the field, the direct conversion of nitrates in wastewater into ammonia to provide nitrogen source for crops is the most direct way for nitrogen cycle. Using solar power to drive the above device can not only reduce the cost of electricity, but also realize the self-driven sustainable operation of ammonia synthesis. This requires the stable operation of the electrolyzer over a wide voltage range. Under this scenario, we further simulated the ammonia production by electrolysis of nitrates driven by solar energy Figure S20.

Upon assessing the NO3RR performance, it is essential to decode the specific role of Mo and Fe dual single-atom alloy in ammonia electrosynthesis. Generally, NO3RR usually follows 10.1002anie.202509303 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

Figure 4a-4c shows the potential-dependent partial current densities of NO2 jNO2, ammonia jNH3 and HER jH2 for Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene in comparison to Fe1Pd, Mo1Pd bimetallenes, and Pd metallene, respectively Figure S21. For NO3NO2 conversion, the jNO2 arranges as follow: Mo1Pd Pd Fe1Pd Mo1Fe1Pd Figure 4a. In contrast, the jNH3 is listed as Mo1Fe1Pd Fe1Pd Mo1Pd Pd. By comparing the results of Fe1Pd, Mo1Pd and Pd samples, it is concluded that alloying single-atom Mo in Pd matrix greatly enhances jNO2, while single-atom Fe in Pd lattice increases jNH3 and weakens jNO2. Considering the promotion effect of single-atom Mo and Fe on process i and ii, alloying dual single-atom Mo and Fe in Pd lattice may cascade NO3NO2 by Mo and NO2NH3 by Fe processes in NO3RR. The above supposition was verified by the smallest jNO2 and the largest jNH3 of Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene. As a major side reaction, water splitting process not only releases hydrogen, but also provides active hydrogen H atoms. As nine H are involved in NO3RR, therefore the kinetics of water splitting greatly determines the final NH3 yield rate and NH3 FE, especially in the more negative potential area. On the one hand, the sluggish kinetics of water splitting process is not enough to provide sufficient H for the subsequent deoxyreduction processes, resulting in weakened NH3 yield rate. However, the too fast kinetics of water splitting boosts H formation and aggravates HER, leading to an awful NH3 FE. The trade-off water splitting activity directly determines NH3 yield rate and NH3 FE. As shown in Figure 4c, jH2 is declined for Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene in comparison to Fe1Pd bimetallene and Pd metallene, comparable with that of Mo1Pd bimetallene. The possible reason may be due to the regulated MH MPd, Mo, Fe bond strength after alloying",

As a result, the N-selectivity of NH3 was greatly enhanced, and NO2 was completely suppressed for Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene Figure S22. Beyond that, the chemical redox reaction of Pd and NO3 also contributed the NO2 formation in NO3RR, similar with the role of single-atom Mo. The oxidized Pd species was further reduced to metallic Pd in the operation of NO3RR Figures S23-S25.37 Based on the above analysis, the detailed mechanism of dual single-atom Mo and Fe in Pd for NO3RR was summarized in Figure S26. Moreover, electrochemical active surface area ECSA was also obtained, Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene delivered a higher ECSA than that of Mo1Pd, Fe1Pd bimetallenes, and Pd metallene, which also contributed to the enhanced NO3RR performance Figure S27. To further investigate why the single-atom Mo and Fe sites can cascade NO3RR, in situ spectroscopic characterizations were carried out to clarify the reaction pathway. Potential-dependent in situ attenuated total reflection flourier transform infrared spectroscopy ATR-FTIR measurements were conducted both for Mo1Fe1Pd, Mo1Pd, Fe1Pd samples. Figure 4d-4f shows the potential-resolved ATR-FTIR spectra in NO3RR from 0 to 0.9 V V versus RHE of Mo1Fe1Pd, Fe1Pd and Mo1Pd samples, respectively. As shown in Figure 4d, the signal of NO3 and NO2 located at 1193 and 1230 cm1 was emerged at 0.1 V, indicating the conversion of NO3 to NO2.38,39 Then, three obvious vibration peaks located at 1010, 1082 and 1340 cm1 arose at 0.2 V, which were attributed to ρasNH2, νNO and νNH4, respectively, suggesting the formation of NH3.3941 Compared with NO2, the intensity of ρasNH2 and νNH4 increased sharply when the applied potential was lower than 0.35 V, suggesting the accelerated conversion of NO3-to-NH3. The result well explains the enhanced jNH3 and NH3 FE. 10.1002anie.202509303 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

The peak located at 1641 cm1 was assigned to νO-H of interfacial H2O molecule.44 The above possible pathway coincided with that of in situ Raman spectra in NO3RR Figure S28. Notably, the signal of the key intermediates was all emerged on Fe1Pd bimetallene Figure 4e, Mo1Pd bimetallene Figure 4f and Pd metallene Figure S29, suggesting the similar reaction pathway on Fe1Pd, Mo1Pd bimetallenes, and Pd metallene. That is to say dual single-atom Mo and Fe doping in Pd matrix does not change the reaction pathway of NO3RR. Moreover, it should be emphasized that Mo1Fe1Pd sample delivered higher ATR-FTIR intensity than that of Fe1Pd, Mo1Pd bimetallenes, and Pd metallene, proofing the enhanced NO3RR performance of Mo1Fe1Pd. As a stark contrast, only the signal of ρasNH2 and νNH4 with much lower intensity was observed on Pd metallene, further confirming the greatly enhanced NO3RR performance of dual single-atom Mo and Fe alloy trimetallene. In addition to the type and strength of the N-intermediates signal, it was observed the difference of the position for NO, NH2OH and NH2. Specifically, the signal of NO arose at 1439 and 1511 cm1 for Fe1Pd and Mo1Pd, respectively. While, the signal of NO was located at 1511 cm1 for Mo1Fe1Pd, coincided with that of Mo1Pd Figure 4g. As determined by XAFS results, Mo1Fe1Pd sample possesses two distinct sites, i.e., Mo and Fe sites, therefore, it is inferred that NO could be adsorbed on Mo site for Mo1Fe1Pd sample. Accordingly, the ATR-FTIR signal of NH2OH and NH2 were located at 1545 and 1010 cm1 for Mo1Fe1Pd sample, more closer to that of Mo1Pd and Fe1Pd samples, respectively. The results indicate that NH2OH could be adsorbed on Mo site, while NH2 was adsorbed on Fe site. Based on the above results, we infer that the N-intermediates occur continuous spillover between Mo and Fe sites as the hydrogenation process proceeds. Obviously, the intermediates spillover was driven 10.1002anie.202509303 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

To further investigate the role of dual single-atom Mo and Fe alloy on the water splitting, the signal of the interfacial water structure between 3000 and 3800 cm1 were truncated from the in situ ATR-FTIR spectra.45 Figure 4h and 4i shows the potential-resolved interfacial water structure signal of Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene and Fe1Pd bimetallene, respectively, which were divided into three peaks by Gaussian fitting, i.e., 4-HBH2O 3200 cm1, 2-HBH2O 3400 cm1 and KH2O 3600 cm1.46 Alloying single-atom Fe in Pd lattice facilitated the formation of KH2O due to the oxytropism of Fe element Figures S30, S31, consistent with previous results.47 As such, Fe1Pd bimetallene delivered higher ratio of KH2O signal than that of Pd metallene. Generally, KH2O improves the kinetics of water splitting reaction due to the lower activation energy, and thus more active hydrogen atoms are formed on the catalyst surface.48 The results well explain the enhanced NO3RR performance and the enlarged jH2 for Fe1Pd sample. Further alloy single-atom Mo in Fe1Pd alloy decreased the proportion of the KH2O for Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene. As a result, the fast kinetics of water cracking to produce H was decreased, accordingly, the coupling of H and H to release hydrogen was inhibited. Finally, enhanced NH3 yield rate and the approaching 100 NH3 FE were synchronously achieved for Mo1Fe1Pd sample. Density functional theory DFT calculations were performed to further investigate the intrinsic mechanism of dual single-atom Mo and Fe doping in Pd metallene Mo1Fe1Pd for NO3RR. According to the previous results, Pd metallene enclosed with 111 plane was employed as the slab.28 The optimized structural models of Fe1Pd, Mo1Pd, and Mo1Fe1Pd 10.1002anie.202509303 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

Considering the complexity of the catalytic sites for Mo1Fe1Pd sample, the Gibbs free energy diagrams for NO3RR on Mo1Pd and Fe1Pd bimetallenes were firstly calculated Table S3. As shown in Figures S33-S35, the RDSs on Fe1Pd and Mo1Pd are NO H eNHO ΔGmax 0.89 eV and NH2 H e NH3 ΔGmax 1.03 eV in NO3RR, respectively. The results indicate that NO2NH3 conversion is inhibited on Mo1Pd, hence NO2 prefers to be obtained. In contrast, the energy barrier of the RDS on Fe1Pd is lower than that on Mo1Pd, NO2 has a larger tendency to be converted to NH3. The above results well explain the larger jNO2 for Mo1Pd and larger jNH3 for Fe1Pd Figure 4a, 4b. Based on the above analysis, the Gibbs free",

The above results well explain the larger jNO2 for Mo1Pd and larger jNH3 for Fe1Pd Figure 4a, 4b. Based on the above analysis, the Gibbs free energy diagrams for NO3RR on Mo1Fe1Pd were further calculated. Notably, Mo and Fe sites were co-existed, energy diagrams on Mo and Fe sites for Mo1Fe1Pd Figures 5a, S36, S37, Table S3 were calculated, respectively. The RDSs are NONHO and NHOHNH2OH with energy barrier of 0.62 and 0.33 eV on Mo and Fe sites, respectively. From the above results, it is reasonably inferred that N-intermediates may experience different catalytic sites from the viewpoint of the minimum energy principle. To further support the conclusion, the adsorption energy of all the N-intermediates in NO3RR were calculated and compared. As shown in Figure 5b, NHO and NH2 intermediates prefer to adsorb on Fe site with larger adsorption energies, while the other N-intermediates tend to adsorb on Mo site in the case of coexistence of Mo and Fe sites, i.e., Mo1Fe1Pd sample. The result suggests that N-intermediates may hop back and forth between Mo and Fe sites in NO3RR. Therefore, the optimal pathway of NO3RR for Mo1Fe1Pd is achieved on alternant Mo and Fe sites, and the RDS is changed to NONHO with the ultralow ΔGmax value of 0.12 eV Figure 5c. 10.1002anie.202509303 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

Subsequently, NO is further hydrogenated to NHO and adsorbed on Fe site, followed by spillover to Mo site, and NHOH is adsorbed on Mo site. After hydrogenation of NHOH to NH2OH on Mo site, NH2OH is dehydrated and spilled over to Fe site again. Finally, NH3 is formed through one step hydrogenation and desorption processes. The reaction intermediates spill over three times between Mo and Fe sites in the entire NO3RR process, ultimately avoiding the large energy barriers of the RDS on Mo1Pd and Fe1Pd. Benefitting from the continuous intermediates spillover effect, the RDS on Mo1Fe1Pd is changed to NONHO with ultralow energy barrier of 0.12 eV, much lower than that of Mo1Pd and Fe1Pd samples. As such, electrochemical NO3RR on Mo1Fe1Pd is greatly accelerated, aligned with the partial current density results Figure 4a, 4b. To investigate the electronic structure of dual single-atom alloy metallene, projected density of states PDOS of metal valence orbitals in Fe1Pd, Mo1Pd, and Mo1Fe1Pd were calculated and compared Figure 5e.

To investigate the electronic structure of dual single-atom alloy metallene, projected density of states PDOS of metal valence orbitals in Fe1Pd, Mo1Pd, and Mo1Fe1Pd were calculated and compared Figure 5e. The results demonstrated that Mo1Pd exhibited higher d-band center εd 2.18 eV than Fe1Pd εd 2.41 eV, and the εd value of Mo1Fe1Pd was adjusted to a moderate level of 2.25 eV due to the co-doping of atomic Mo and Fe atoms, which can effectively regulate the interaction between metal active sites and the reaction intermediates. Based on the single active site, the adsorption energies of the N-intermediates exhibited obvious linear scaling relationship between Fe1Pd and Mo1Pd Figure 5f. Moreover, Mo1Pd owned stronger adsorption of intermediates compared to Fe1Pd, which was the primary reason why NH3 desorption was the RDS for Mo1Pd. The adsorption energies of the different intermediates on Fe1Pd, Mo1Pd, and Mo1Fe1Pd were compared and displayed in Figure 5g. The results suggest that dual single-atom Mo and Fe sites in Mo1Fe1Pd can break the linear adsorption of intermediates on the single active site, which plays an important role in enhancing the electrocatalytic activity for NO3RR. Therefore, the co-doping of Mo and Fe atoms in Pd 10.1002anie.202509303 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

In addition, the water splitting process for H supply was also calculated Figure S38, Table S4. H2OOH H process occurred on Fe1Pd111 or Fe site-Mo1Fe1Pd111 all delivered lower energy barriers than that of Mo1Pd111 and Mo site-Mo1Fe1Pd111, suggesting Fe doping in Pd matrix indeed facilitates HOH bond breakage. As a result, the kinetics of NO3RR to NH3 conversion was accordingly improved, consistent with the variation trend of the partial current density Figure 4c. The excellent NO3RR performance of Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene enables the exploration of NO3RR in a zinc-nitrate Zn-NO3 battery. A hybrid aqueous Zn-NO3 battery catalyzed by Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene was assembled combined with a Zn anode Figure 6a. The anolyte was 3 M KOH solution and the catholyte was 3 M KOH 0.5 M KNO3. The assembled Zn-NO3 battery delivered a stable open-circuit voltage OCV of 1.477 V, higher than that of Mo1Pd, Fe1Pd and Pd metallenes electrodes Figure 6b. A maximum discharge power density of 13.4 mW cm2 was achieved, higher than that of Mo1Pd bimetallenes 3.7 mW cm2, Fe1Pd bimetallens 4.8 mW cm2 and Pd metallenes 2.6 mW cm2 Figure 6c. The rate capability of the battery was assessed at the current densities of 2, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mA cm2, demonstrating the excellent discharge stability Figure 6d.

Two batteries in series could light LED lights and drive the small fan continuously for 16 hours Figure 6h, demonstrating the excellent application prospect. In brief, the well-designed battery could work consecutively as an energy-chemical output device for practical ammonia production and continuous power output. 3. Conclusions In summary, a highly efficient and durable dual single-atom Mo1Fe1Pd alloy metallene was synthesized for electrochemical nitrate conversion to ammonia. Atomically dispersed molybdenum and iron atoms in Pd lattice provided two distinct catalytic sites, enabling the continuous intermediates spillover between Mo and Fe sites. So that NO3RR experienced the lowest energy barrier for each elementary step, which was confirmed by in situ spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations. Furthermore, the co-doping of Mo and Fe atoms altered the interfacial water structure to restrain the competing HER, as well as regulated the electronic structure, resulting in high NH3 yield rate and NH3 FE synchronously. Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene delivered a remarkable NH3 yield rate of 13.4 mol gcat.1 h1 and NH3 FE of 94.6, as well as excellent cycling stability. Moreover, the assembled zinc-nitrate battery delivered an OCV of 1.477 V, and the maximum output power density of 13.4 mW cm2. This work provides new insights into the design of efficient, selective and durable electrocatalysts for multi-steps and multi-intermediates involved electrosynthesis process from the angle of intermediates hopping effect.

Here, we resolve this conundrum by identifying a high- valent anionic intermediate as kinetic gatekeepers during the nitrate reduction on a single-atom catalyst by using AIMD simulations under explicit solvation and electrode potentials. Employing our self-developed constant-potential thermodynamic integration method, we reveal a stark kinetic barrier dichotomy: while the reaction is thermodynamically favorable governed by the NO break, the protonation to oxygen at a low anionic state necessitates substantial activation energy. Mechanistic analysis uncovers that electrode polarization preactivates NO3 into a metastable high-valent NO3 2 intermediate, which serves as the key step to the following protonation process. Crucially, this intermediates stabilization requires a highly negative potential, directly linking its formation to the observed overpotential. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations also demonstrate that K cations play a key role in electrostatically stabilizing the adsorption of negatively charged NO3 onto the negatively polarized cathode. This work calls for the urgent reconsideration of conventional nitrate reduction mechanisms and the exigency of refined interface design principles for improved nitrate electrocatalysis. INTRODUCTION Since the 1980s, electrochemical nitrate reduction NO3 RR has traditionally been proposed for sewage treatment, facilitating the conversion of nitrate into innocuous nitrogen N2.13 Recently, there has emerged a revitalized interest in NO3 RR, motivated by the goal of producing ammonia NH3 instead.4,5 Therefore, electrochemical nitrate reduction repre- sents a sustainable pathway and a promising route for both water treatment and ammonia generation. The practical applications of NO3 RR in energy and environment, however, face a significant challenge due to its exceptionally high overpotential, despite the thermodynamically favorable path- ways with theoretical equilibrium potentials of 1.17 V vs SHE for N2 and 0.12 V vs SHE for NH3 formation. The universal initial two-electron 2e reduction of nitrate to nitrite is generally identified to be a rate-determining step.68 There are two popular contradictory hypotheses regarding the mechanism of reduction of nitrate to nitrite in the NO3 RR. One genre believes that nitrate reduction begins with a protonation process where NO3 interacts with H in solution to form adsorbed HNO3 at the electrode NO3 H HNO3, which is considered a solution-mediated proton transfer reaction and does not require electron transfer.9,10 Then, the formed HNO3 undergoes a process of protonation and dehydration to produce NO2. However, this does not conform to the common chemical knowledge that HNO3 is a strong electrolyte and would inevitably electrolyze into the proton and nitrate ion. The other representation points out that NO3 first undergoes an oxidative associative adsorption, where NO3 is adsorbed and discharged to form NO3 NO3 NO3 e.7,8,1115 Subsequent reduction and hydrogenation pro- cesses lead to the formation of NO2 or NO2 .

However, the oxidative adsorption is unlikely to proceed at the cathode electrode, where the electroreduction of NO3 is operated. Therefore, the mechanism of nitrate anion adsorption on the cathode remains controversial, and the origin of the high overpotential required for NO3 reduction is still poorly understood. Metalnitrogencarbon MNC, M Fe, Co, Mn, Ni, etc. single atom electrocatalysts,16,17 with a well-defined atomic structure, have emerged as a class of ideal model systems for fundamental studies to investigate the electro- catalytic mechanism.

For example, gaseous H2 and HNO3 are often chosen as reference points for calculating the binding energy of NO3 , as proposed by Calle-Vallejo et al.19 GNO d3 GNO d3 G GHNO d3g 12GH d2g Gcorrect. A large number of DFT calculations based on the CHE model have indicated that the rate-determining step of the transition of nitrate to nitrite is markedly exothermic. However, many catalysts such as Fe NC catalysts exhibit a significant overpotential exceeding 0.6 V.79,11,12,2022 Therefore, current theoretical calculations fail to explain the origin of the high overpotential, strongly suggesting that previously overlooked dynamic processes or complex interface effects may have played a key role. It is only within the past few years that an ever-increasing understanding of dynamically electrified solidliquid interfaces has started to trigger a return to this foundational pillar of electrochemistry, namely, uncovering the roles of electrode potential and solvent in electrochemical reactions under realistic electrochemical conditions,23,24 notably, in the CO2RR,25,26 ORR,27 and NRR.28 Unlike these neutrally charged small molecule reactants like CO2 and N2, NO3 ions are negatively charged in solution, which is expected to result in a significantly different mechanism. Nevertheless, it is fair to acknowledge that no study has yet provided a definitive description of the reduction behavior of NO3 at the electrodeelectrolyte interfaces. Here, we uncover the origin of the high overpotential for NO3 RR on the FeNC catalyst by employing the self- developed constant potential kinetic modeling method. Specifically, the critical roles of electrode potential and cations in the reaction mechanism were revealed. The 2ereduction pathway from nitrate to nitrite is characterized as exothermic thermodynamically, but our calculations show a notable kinetic energy barrier that must be surmounted.

The electrode potential plays its role in accelerating the reaction kinetics by preactivating NO3 to high-valent NO3 2, while K at the interface stabilizes the negatively charged NO3 2by electro- static interactions. Notably, the observed high overpotential is attributed to the highly negative reduction potential required for the conversion of NO3 to NO3 2. Our results highlight the pronounced electrostatic interactions at the electro- chemical interface in stabilizing charged reaction intermediates and provide new mechanism insights into the NO3 reduction process. This work explains the origin of experimentally observed high overpotentials, which cannot be accounted for by traditional models. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The Role of K in Nitrate Adsorption. First, explicit counterion models were constructed to examine the dynamic adsorption of nitrate at the FeN4Cwater interface Figure S4. In the explicit counterions model, different numbers of K atoms were added, which spontaneously convert to hydrated K and charge the electrode surface. In the K-Inter model, K was placed on the side of the adsorbate at the interface Figure 1. Role of K. The FeO distances that vary with the number of cations a; potential-dependent charge on NO3 b; the adsorption energy of NO3 at 0.82 V vs RHE c; and the charge on NO3 during adsorption d.

By contrast, the K-Back model placed the K at about 15 Å away from the interface, and the K and adsorbate were on either side of the slab due to the periodicity of the model, thereby avoiding direct interaction between the K and nitrate. These two models enable a comparison of how cations influence the electrochemical reaction at the interface under varying applied potentials. Each model ran at least 10 ps AIMD simulations to adequately equilibrate, and the density distribution of water and the distribution of K were analyzed from the trajectory at different electrode potentials Figure S5. In the K-Inter model and K-Back model, the distributions of water and K are symmetrical with respect to the electrode surface. An evident first water adsorption peak appears within 24 Å of the surfaces, reaching a maximum density of water of about 2.0 gcm3. After the first layer of water, there is a depletion of water with a minimum density of 0.5 gcm3 at about 5 Å. Further away from the surface, the wave fluctuations of water are gradually suppressed, and the density is recovered with an average value of around 1.0 gcm3. However, the K are distributed dynamically within the range of 26 Å away from the surface of the FeN4C electrode. We then investigated the adsorption behavior of nitrate by collecting bond length and charge in AIMD simulations, as shown in Figure 1. NO3 is adsorbed on the FeN4C catalyst via",

    "text": "However, the K are distributed dynamically within the range of 26 Å away from the surface of the FeN4C electrode. We then investigated the adsorption behavior of nitrate by collecting bond length and charge in AIMD simulations, as shown in Figure 1. NO3 is adsorbed on the FeN4C catalyst via an end-on configuration, in which one O atom of the nitrate binds with the Fe center. It can be observed in Figure 1a that the length of the FeO bond in the K-Back model remains at 2 Å until the number of K ions increase to 5, when it suddenly becomes longer longer than 5 Å. This indicates that NO3 is desorbed due to the electrostatic repulsion with the negatively polarized electrode surface as the number of K increases. By contrast, the FeO bond length in the K-Inter model fluctuates in the range of 23 Å, where the location of nitrate is perturbed by the dynamic distribution of K at the interface. These results demonstrate that the K cations play a crucial stabilizing role in the nitrate anion adsorption process. In the K-Back model, the NO3 species maintains both its monovalent character of 0.85 e and a N O bond length of 1.27 Å across the entire potential window. Notably, a potential-dependent charge accumulation phenom- enon was observed in the K-Inter model. At an electrode potential of around 0.8 V vs RHE, we observed a significant additional charge transfer of about 0.6 e to NO3 Figure 1b, converting to a high-valent NO3 2 anion. This transformation is accompanied by a distinct structural change, as evidenced by the elongation of the average NO bond length from 1.27 to 1.37 Å, indicative of nitrate activation. The stabilized adsorption of the high-valent NO3 2species can be attributed to enhanced electrostatic interactions with neighboring K cations, as confirmed by our electronic structure analysis Figure S6. These findings demonstrate a unique nitrate activation that is specifically enabled by the K-Inter model, highlighting the crucial role of electrostatic interactions in stabilizing nitrate adsorption at the electrified interfaces. Further, our recently developed Constant-Potential Ther- modynamic Integration CPTI method29,30 was employed to calculate the reaction energetics of nitrate adsorption in K- Inter and K-Back models at the electrode potential of 0.82 V. The CPTI method enables realistic modeling of the electrochemical interface, and the efficient free energy calculations are based on a robust surface charge density descriptor. At each collective variable CV chosen along with the reaction pathways, the CPTI method was applied to regulate the total number of electrons of the system to keep the electrode potential constant. By collecting the mean force of constraint at each CV Figure S7 and integrating over the mean force of constraint with respect to the CV, the free energy under fixed potential can be computed. The free energy curves in Figure 1c suggest that the adsorption energy of nitrate is only about 0.1 eV with a negligible energy barrier, which is thermally accessible. Moreover, the location of K hardly changes",

The free energy curves in Figure 1c suggest that the adsorption energy of nitrate is only about 0.1 eV with a negligible energy barrier, which is thermally accessible. Moreover, the location of K hardly changes the adsorption energy of nitrate. Nevertheless, we found a difference in the charged state of the nitrate at adsorption Figure 1d. In both models, the electrode potential is maintained at the preset potential of 0.82 V during the reaction. It is worth noting that in the K-Back model, the charge of nitrate during adsorption is kept at 0.85 e, while in the K-Inter model, nitrate accepts about 0.6 additional electrons during adsorption, transforming from NO3 to NO3 2. This result can be interpreted as a shift of adsorption from physiosorbed NO3 in the K-Back model to chemisorbed and activated NO3 2in the K-Inter model. Thus, all results suggest that the nitrate is adsorbed on the surface of the electrode in the form of anions and emphasize the crucial role of electrostatic stabilization by K in the process of chemical adsorption and activation of NO3 into NO3 2on the FeN4C electrode. Recognizing the pivotal contribution of cations to the reaction mechanism, we focus on the K-Inter model to restore the dynamic behavior of K on the interface in the following discussion. The Mechanism of Nitrate Reduction. In a series of AIMD simulations at different electrode potentials, the dynamic evolution of nitrate reduction from NO3 to NO2 was captured uniquely at the electrode potential of 0.85 V. As displayed in Figure 2a, the evolution of nitrate reduction proceeds where the proton is first transferred to the adsorbed NO3 , followed by dissociation of hydroxide anions, leaving an adsorbed NO2 on the FeN4C electrode surface in a period of several hundred femtoseconds during the AIMD simulations. The change of bond length Figure 2b Figure 2. Evolutions in AIMD simulations. The change of potential energy a and distance b of nitrate reduction from NO3 to NO2 at 0.85 V vs RHE. Journal of the American Chemical Society pubs.acs.orgJACS Article https:doi.org10.1021jacs.5c05728 J. Am. Chem. Soc. XXXX, XXX, XXXXXX C also shows that the HO bond is formed with a bond length of 1.0 Å after proton transfer, subsequently followed by NO bond cleavage from a bond length of 1.3 Å during hydroxide dissociation. At a more positive electrode potential of 0.05 to 0.77 V, NO3 can be stably adsorbed during the simulations without obvious structure evolutions Figure S8. Inspired by this observation, we then employed the CPTI method again to calculate the reaction energetics of nitrate reduction at the representative electrode potentials of 0.55 V and 0.82 V. In order to capture the metastable intermediates, we have chosen two sets of CVs for the proton transfer step and hydroxide dissociation step, respectively, to dissect the 2e reduction reaction of nitrate to nitrite. The free energy diagrams along the reaction pathway are shown in Figure 3,",

In order to capture the metastable intermediates, we have chosen two sets of CVs for the proton transfer step and hydroxide dissociation step, respectively, to dissect the 2e reduction reaction of nitrate to nitrite. The free energy diagrams along the reaction pathway are shown in Figure 3, and the average force curves of CPTI simulations are collected in Figure S9. At an electrode potential of 0.55 V, nitrate reduction from NO3 to NO2 is a significantly exothermic process of about 2.63 eV, but there is a notable barrier of 0.92 eV Figure 3a. Specifically, the proton transfer for NO3 is endothermic with a free energy of 0.92 0.01 eV, while the hydroxide dissociation from NO2OHto NO2 is exothermic with a free energy of 1.59 0.02 eV. The evolution of structures along the reaction pathway in Figure 3b shows that the NO bond of NO3 is 1.29 Å, while the NO bonds are 1.27 and 1.32 Å in NO2 . There is a process of electron transfer required to charge the metastable inter- mediate for subsequent hydroxide dissociation after proton transfer. By contrast, when the electrode potential is reduced to 0.82 V, the energy barrier of the reduction reaction caused by the proton transfer step is greatly reduced to only 0.30 0.01 eV. It is worth emphasizing that prior to the proton transfer step, NO3 has first undergone reduction to NO3 2during adsorption at the electrode potential of 0.82 V, as supported in the previous sections. The protonation of preactivated NO3 2is largely easier to occur kinetically than the direct protonation of NO3 with a reduction of reaction energy of about 0.6 eV. The evolution of structures along the reaction pathway also confirmed the potential-dependent activation of NO3 with a longer NO bond of NO3 2of 1.36 Å at 0.82 V than that at 0.55 V. The results suggest that the activation of nitrate induced by electrode potential determines the further reduction kinetics to nitrite. The regulation of the electrode potential and the total number of electrons added to the system along with the reaction coordinates are displayed in Figure 4. The electrode potentials along the reaction pathways are all within the set convergence threshold centered on 0.55 V and 0.82 V in Figure 4a,c, respectively, during the CPTI simulations. The solid lines show the total number of electrons added to the system during proton transfer blue and hydroxide dissoci- ation sampled as red. It takes about 2 electrons for the reduction reaction from NO3 to NO2 and about 1 electron for the reduction reaction from NO3 2to NO2 . The change in charge on intermediates was also analyzed, which allowed one to consider the following nitrate reduction mechanism. At 0.55 V Figure 4b, during proton transfer blue line, the charge on NO3 and the total charge on NO3 and the transferring proton denoted as NO3 H were collected. With the progress of the reaction, the charge on charged NO3 changes a little, staying about 1e, while the",

With the progress of the reaction, the charge on charged NO3 changes a little, staying about 1e, while the NO3 H remains neutrally charged with about 0.3e. This reveals that the proton transfer for NO3 participates by Figure 3.

During hydroxide dissociation red line, the charge on NO2 and the total charge on NO2 and the dissociating OHdenoted as NO2 OH were collected. With the progress of the reaction, the charge difference of charged NO2 OHand NO2 is increased to 0.7 e. This indicates that the OH species gradually gains an electron and dissociates into solutions as OH. It is worth noting that after the proton transfer and before the hydroxide dissociation, one electron is transferred to form negatively charged NO2OH in the yellow shaded area. At 0.82 V, a similar charge analysis was carried out as shown in Figure 4d, and the following 2ereduction reaction mechanism was hypothesized. NO3 initially obtains the first electron for prereduction to form high-valent NO3 2eq 1; then, NO3 2undergoes the protonation process and subsequently obtains the second electron to dissociate into NO2 and OHeq 2. Detailed charge distribution analysis suggests that the electron accumulation on a specific oxygen atom of the nitrate molecule, as complemented by background charge, drives the dissociation of the OHgroup Figure S10. The density of states DOS was also conducted to show that the arrangement of d orbitals of the Fe center is evolved as the electrode potential decreases to promote the adsorption and activation of nitrate at the active Fe center Figure S11. Thus, the d orbitals of the Fe active center act as a medium for electron transfer, bridging the electrode surface and NO3 .

Our calculations indicate that a significant energy barrier must be overcome in the reduction process to nitrite, despite the reaction being thermodynamically exothermic. The crucial intermediate of NO3 2along with the determining step in the reaction pathway has been identified. The 2ereduction of NO3 to form NO2 by direct protonation is kinetically extremely challenging.

Intriguingly, when NO3 is first activated to NO3 2by a reduction step, the subsequent protonation and one-electron reduction processes to form NO2 are significantly facilitated. However, the reduction potential required for the conversion of NO3 to NO3 2is highly negative, accounting for the experimentally observed high overpotential for nitrate reduction. Our calculations reveal that it is a decoupled process where electron transfer precedes proton transfer in the 2ereduction process. That is why the traditional CHE model failed in this system as the model assumes a coupled proton and electron transfer. Consequently, it is indicated that the preactivation of NO3 is the potential- determining step, while the protonation process is the rate- determining step during the 2enitrate reduction. Further- more, the essential role of electrode potential in accelerating reaction kinetics through preactivation of NO3 to NO3 2is highlighted.

We provide a schematic representation of interfacial interactions involved in nitrate reduction in Figure 5a. Within the Helmholtz plane, there are many charged species with ubiquitous electrostatic interactions and dynamic polarization phenomena. Specifically, at the negatively polarized electrode surface, hydrated alkali metal cations, which are commonly used as supporting electrolytes, are expected to partially localize in the Helmholtz plane. This behavior creates a large interfacial potential drop as pictured in Figure 5b, which dominates the occurrence of electrochemical electron transfer ET processes. As the negatively charged NO3 ions migrate into the interfacial Figure 5. Physical picture of electrochemical interface dynamics.

In addition to electrostatic effects, the solvation effect would also play a role in stabilizing the adsorption of charged intermediates Figure S12. When the electrode potential drops to the reduction potential, one electron transfers from the electrode to the nitrate at the interface, converting NO3 into high-valent NO3 2. Under this electrode potential, the electrostatic repulsion between the electrode and NO3 2is strengthened, while the corresponding electrostatic attraction between K and NO3 2is also enhanced, thereby stabilizing the adsorption of NO3 2for subsequent reactions. Once the reduction potential of NO3 to NO3 2is reached, the protonation process becomes kinetically more favorable, allowing the 2ereduction from NO3 to NO2 to proceed efficiently. We reaffirm that the high-valent NO3 2anion predicted in our theoretical study during the two-electron reduction of nitrate is metastable with a very short lifetime. It is anticipated that advanced time-resolved spectroscopic techni- ques may enable its detection in future studies. Strategies such as the cation,31 electrode potential,32 halogen electrolyte,33 and heterostructure34,35 have been proposed to improve the performance of electrocatalytic nitrate reduction. For example, Wen et al.31 found that K can regulate the electrostatic potential distribution and proton transport in the electric double layer, thus enhancing the kinetics for the conversion of NO3 . Moreover, a series of alkali metal ions Li, Na, K were compared, and it was found that due to the smallest radius of K hydrated cations, the effects were more significant in promoting charge transfer and nitrate reduction. Guo et al.32 proposed to unitize electrode potential to control the active siteintermediate interactions to enhance NO reduction reactivity on oxygen vacancy-modified TiO2. These studies support our calculations here that alkali metal cations can promote the adsorption of nitrate ions, highlighting the key regulatory role of the electrochemical interface micro- environment including electrode potential and electrolyte composition in the kinetics of electrocatalytic reduction reactions. Future studies could further discuss the effects of different species of cation. We anticipate that our work will inspire the development of refined interface design principles for improved nitrate electrocatalysis. CONCLUSIONS In this work, a full explicit model combined with constant potential modeling based on density functional theory was employed. Our work resolves a long-standing puzzle of the high overpotential in nitrate reduction by revealing the mechanism with a particular emphasis on the roles of electrode potential and cations. First, NO3 is observed to absorb on the negatively polarized electrode surface as an anionic species. Subsequently, constant potential kinetics calculations indicate that the 2ereduction pathway from nitrate to nitrite is thermodynamically exothermic, yet it encounters a significant reaction energy barrier. Further, the first electron transfer, driven by the electrode potential, activates NO3 to NO3 2 and emerges as the key of 2ereduction of nitrate to nitrite. Importantly, the electrostatic stabilization provided by K is also indispensable for the adsorption of NO3 anions. Due to the highly negative reduction potential for converting NO3 to NO3",

Importantly, the electrostatic stabilization provided by K is also indispensable for the adsorption of NO3 anions. Due to the highly negative reduction potential for converting NO3 to NO3 2, a high overpotential is required experimentally for nitrate reduction. By considering kinetics, which is often overlooked in traditional calculations, as well as the effects of the electrode potential and cations, this work offers critical insights and timely guidance for electrochemical nitrate reduction. Our findings also call for the urgent reexamination of conventional nitrate reduction mechanisms and the exigency of refined interface design principles to advance electrocatalytic performance.

The Γ-point sampling of the Brillouin zone was used due to the large computation cost.44 The NoseHoover thermostat was employed, and the time step was set as 1.0 fs.

Here, we systematically investigate the electrochemical synthesis of hydroxylamine via a formaldehyde-mediated method on titanium oxides. An electrochromic rutile array prepared via a wet-chemical route achieved a Faradaic efficiency FE of 92.6 for formaldehyde oxime and a corresponding yield rate of up to 2085 μmol cm2 h1 under ambient conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal that the electrochromism is a macroscopic manifestation of the protonation of Ob bridging oxygen sites and the formation of Ov oxygen vacancies and Ti3, which act as proton sponges and electron reservoirs. Formaldehyde not only serves as the capturing agent but also helps to stabilize NH2OH through molecular tuning, thereby achieving high selectivity. Through formaldehyde-nitrate electro-reforming, hydrogen, formic acid, and hydroxylamine can be coproduced at 200 mA cm2 under an ultralow cell voltage of 0.78 V. This work links the catalytic performance of hydroxylamine electrosynthesis to the dynamic surface of titanium oxides, offering insights into selectivity control in nitrate electroreduction and providing a green, cost-effective alternative to conventional hydroxylamine synthesis. INTRODUCTION Nitrogen is a vital element for all life forms and plays a crucial role in industrial production and daily life.1,2 However, the industrial processes and artificial nitrogen conversions have elicited a persistent imbalance in the nitrogen cycle Figure 1a, resulting in the accumulation of harmful nitrates and nitrites in environment, thereby leading to a series of ecological crises.35 In recent years, the electroreduction of nitrate NO3 and nitrite NO2 , preferably powered by renewable energy, has emerged as a promising strategy to restore a balanced nitrogen cycle, garnering increasing attention.68 Electrochemical nitrate reduction NO3RR effectively removes nitrate pollutants from wastewater and converts it into valuable chemicals, facilitating the recycling of nitrogen resources9,10 Current research focuses primarily on two strategies Figure 1b: reducing NO3 into dinitrogen N2 for water purification11 and converting NO3 into ammonia NH3 for nitrogen fertilizer production.12 The main by- products in these processes are hydrogen and nitrite NO2 , with barely any other products reported. Hydroxylamine NH2OH is an important nitrogenous feedstock and is extensively used in synthesizing various nitrogen-containing compounds in the chemical, pharmaceut- ical and agrochemical industries.1315 Conventional hydroxyl- amine synthesis encompasses diverse routes Raschig, hydro- genations, often facing challenges like multistep processes, byproduct generation, or reliance on harsh conditions, motivating greener electrochemical approaches.1618 In contrast, the route of reducing nitrate into hydroxylamine NO3 to NH2OH using water as the proton source and powered by renewable energy could not only effectively remove the nitrate pollutants from wastewater but also provide a more sustainable avenue toward green production of hydroxylamine.

Inspired by strategies using surface adsorbates to modulate catalytic activity, here we hypothesize that mediators like formaldehyde may play a role more than simply capturing the NH2OH intermediate, but also potentially tuning the reaction pathway via surface interactions. To explore this potential molecular tuning effect27,28 and to develop high-efficiency hydroxylamine synthesis systems, transition metal oxides with rich surface chemistry and tunable structures offer an attractive platform. In particular, titanium dioxide TiO2 has garnered extensive attention by virtue of its stability, cost-effectiveness, and the known role of surface defects like Ov oxygen vacancies in catalysis. Herein, we systematically investigate the formaldehyde- mediated electroreduction of nitrate on various TiO2 phases and facets, focusing on elucidating the interplay between the catalysts dynamic surface associated with its electrochrom- ism and the potential molecular modulating role of form- aldehyde. We developed a high-performance rutile array catalyst via a wet-chemical method, and identified Ti5cOb sites as the active centers facilitating an unconventional nitrate reduction pathway. This rutile array catalyst exhibited a remarkable Faradaic efficiency FE of 92.6 for the formaldehyde oxime product and achieved a yield rate up to 2085 μmol cm2 h1 under ambient conditions. The pronounced electrochromism of this catalyst reflects the dynamic formation of Ov and Ti3, which effectively activate NO3 . Combining in situ characterizations attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared ATR-FTIR, differ- ential electrochemical mass spectrometry DEMS and solid- state NMR ssNMR with density functional theory DFT calculations, we infer that formaldehyde not only acts as a capturing agent but also modifies the catalyst surface forming Ti5cOCH2Ob species, altering the reaction pathway and promoting hydroxylamine intermediate desorption Figure 1c. Finally, we demonstrate an energy-efficient electro- reforming system that coproduces hydrogen, formic acid, and the hydroxylamine precursor at 1 V cell voltage, highlighting its potential industrial viability through techno-economic analysis and device-scale tests.",

A series of commercial TiO2 samples Figure S1 with different crystallo- graphic structures including rutile, anatase, and brookite, as well as P25 were tested. After 1 h electrolysis at 0.8 V vs RHE, the 1H NMR spectra for the electrolyte show distinct peaks corresponding to CH2NOH Figure S2. Notably, the commercial brookite sample exhibits the highest catalytic activity, achieving a FE of 36 Figure 2a. To systematically unravel the structureactivity relation- ships for formaldehyde-mediated nitrate reduction over titanium oxides, we investigated the influence of some key properties of the materials used, including surface coordination sites, defect density Ov, and charge transport characteristics. Our findings are summarized in Figure S3. We began by examining the role of surface sites dictated by crystal phases and exposed facets. Using hydrothermal synthesis, we prepared a series of TiO2 samples with well-defined shapes and specific exposed facets29 see details in Supporting Information, including B brookite, Figure S4 210, A anatase, Figure S5 001, A 101, A 111, and R rutile, Figure S6 110, 111, 331. These specific crystal facets were confirmed via X-ray diffraction XRD, Raman spectroscopy and trans- mission electron microscopy TEM Supplementary Notes 1, 2. Activity tests Figure 2a revealed a rather low performance for the anatase phases; in contrast, brookite B 210 showed a good activity FE 36, similar to commercial brookite. Notably, the rutile samples synthesized via wet-chemistry, such as R 110 and the high-index R 331, exhibited significantly higher activities than commercial rutile. A common feature among these active facets B 210, R 110, R 331 is the presence of the Ti5cOb structural motif Supplementary Note 3 and Figure S7, suggesting its potential role as the active center.

In addition to active sites and defects, an optimized electrocatalytic performance also requires efficient charge transport. To address the potential limitation in electrical conductivity for powder catalysts, we directly grew the rutile array on conductive carbon paper rutile arrayCC, Figure S9. This architecture, ensuring excellent catalyst support interface and inheriting the advantages of wet- chemically synthesized rutile predominantly exposing 110 facets with Ti5cOb sites and inherent Ov, displayed exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity. The rutile array displayed an exceptional FE of 92.6 and a production rate of 1521.5 μmol cm2 h1, indicating a superior catalytic selectivity and intrinsic activity. To evaluate the economic potential of this synthesis strategy for hydroxylamine NH2OH production, we conducted a techno-economic analysis TEA based on recently reported models23 Supplementary Note 6. With the electricity price presumed at 3 centskWh, using the rutile array or other high- selectivity and high-activity catalysts proves profitable Figure 2b. Furthermore, we believe that when the current density exceeds 200 mA cm2 with an efficiency greater than 90, the catalyst would meet the industrial demands of electrochemical production. With the catalytic activity further improved and renewable energy prices further decreased, the costs associated with this strategy would be lowered significantly, demonstrat- ing its promising application potential Figure S10.

A colorimetric method was used to assess the yields of byproducts such as NO2 and NH3 Figures S11, S12. The linear sweep voltammetry LSV curves Figure 2c indicate that the introduction of formaldehyde can suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction HER, as evidenced by a decline in current density, probably because of the competing adsorptions between formaldehyde and H. The current density measured in the nitrate-containing electrolyte was significantly higher than in the 1 M KOH electrolyte, demonstrating the pronounced electrocatalytic activity of the rutile array for nitrate reduction compared with background reactions such as HER under these conditions. The introduction of formaldehyde during the nitrate electro- reduction results in a slight decrease in current density. Over the applied potential range from 0.4 V to 1.0 V, CH2NOH emerges as the main reduction product Figure 2d, with NH3 as the major byproduct in electrolyte and N2O as the major byproduct in gas phase. The total selectivity for CH2NOH is greater than 80 Figure 2e, and the FE trend displays a volcano-like shape, yet with the production rate monotonically increasing. Under the reaction conditions, formaldehyde does not undergo electroreduction to methanol Figure S13, as NO3 would be preferentially reduced over HCHO.30,31 Moreover, the Cannizzaro reaction in alkaline environment within the reaction time frame did not significantly impact the results. Notably, at an applied potential of 0.8 V vs RHE, the FE for CH2NOH reaches 92.6, with an average current density approaching 262 mA cm2. At 1.0 V, the yield rate of CH2NOH over the rutile array is as high as 2085 μmol cm2 h1, standing as one of the highest yield rates reported thus far for NH2OH electrosynthesis Table S1. CH2NOH was not detected in the absence of KNO3 and HCHO, confirming that the carbon and nitrogen sources for CH2NOH do come from HCHO and KNO3 Table S2, respectively. High FEs for CH2NOH can be achieved over a relatively wide range of formaldehyde concentrations Figure S14. Furthermore, the rutile array exhibited an excellent catalytic durability, maintaining a FE of 85 and a yield rate of 1500 μmol cm2 h1 after 20 cycles under the same reaction conditions Figure 2f.

Mechanistic Investigations. It is worth noting that rutile array exhibits a prominent reversible electrochromism Figure 4a, which correlates with its catalytic activity. When the potential reached 0.3 V vs RHE, the catalyst started to turn blue electron and proton injection. The catalyst color in the potential ranges from 0.4 V to 0.9 V changed from light blue to dark blue, and the formaldehyde oxime yield increased rapidly. When the potential reached 1.0 V, numerous bubbles were observed on the catalyst surface Figure S19, indicating the occurrence of HER and the formation of N2O. During a complete cyclic voltametric scan, the catalyst turns blue as the potential goes negative and rapidly bleaches as the potential goes positive along with 0.25 V vs RHE oxidation peak.36 For a more detailed explanation on the reversibility of the entire process, please see Supplementary Note 4 Video S1 and Figures S20, S21. We then employed a variety of character- ization techniques to probe the actual active sites in rutile array Figure S22. For the TiO2 surface, the electrochromism is typically attributed to the light absorption due to free electrons at Ov and the dd transitions of Ti3 in JahnTeller distorted octahedra.37 By comparing the quasi-in situ XPS profiles Figure S23 for the original and colored states preserved and detected under argon atmosphere, it was noted that the binding energy of Ti 2p shifts to lower energy for the colored state. The binding energy decreases by 0.45 eV for the dark- blue sample in sole NO3 reduction and by 0.3 eV for the light-blue sample in NO3 HCHO cooperative reduction, suggesting that the electrochromism is primarily due to the reduction of TiO2 as it accepts electrons, forming Ti3 species.38 We hypothesize that as the potential goes negative, electrons in the catalyst attract protons in the electrolyte onto the surface to form ObH bonds, and simultaneously reduce Ti4 into Ti3. The ObH could further undergo elimination of H2O molecule, yielding Ov. When the material is subjected to a potential more positive than 0.3 V vs RHE or to an oxidizing atmosphere, the Ov would become occupied and the surface- adsorbed hydrogen species would undergo oxidation and desorption Figure S24.39 During the electroreduction of nitrate, the generation",

When the material is subjected to a potential more positive than 0.3 V vs RHE or to an oxidizing atmosphere, the Ov would become occupied and the surface- adsorbed hydrogen species would undergo oxidation and desorption Figure S24.39 During the electroreduction of nitrate, the generation of colored Ti3 species through electrochromism is facilitated by the formation of Ov and TiObH, along with hydrogen insertion. These surface-active species are closely associated with the nitrate reduction and the electrosynthesis of formaldehyde oxime. To probe the electronic structure and surface states of the catalyst under working conditions, we performed operando X- ray absorption spectroscopy XAS to investigate the ensemble average of the near-surface local Ti coordination environment in the Rutile Array samples Figure 4b, S25. Ti K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure XANES profile shows three pre-edge peaks characteristic of rutile at 4969.4, 4972.0, and 4975.1 eV, corresponding to dipole-allowed transitions in the distorted octahedra of rutile: the first peak stems from the quadrupolar transition of 1s 3d t2g, the second from the dipolar transition of 1s 3d t2g 4p hybridized states, and the third from the pure dipolar transitions of 1s 3d eg 4p hybridized states.40 As the potential gradually shifts cathodically, pre-edge peaks with higher intensities emerge, indicative of a broken symmetry, and a more distorted local structure. This implies that the density of Ov increases further at more cathodic potentials, or that the surface adsorbates disrupt the coordination symmetry of Ti, exacerbating the JahnTeller effect.41,42 Simultaneously, at more negative potentials 0.6 V to 0.8 V, the absorption edge shifts to lower energy, and the white line intensity diminishes, indicating a lowered oxidation state of Ti. Semiquantitative fitting reveals a valence state of 3.72 Figure S26. The Fourier transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure FT-EXAFS spectra shows three primary scattering paths Figure 4c: the major peak at 1.5 Å corresponds to the TiO path, the peak at 2.4 Å to TiTi scattering in the second shell, and the peak at 3.1 Å to TiOTi scattering in the third shell. The intensities of these peaks decrease in the order of 0 V, 0.2 V, and 0.8 V, which agrees well with the decrease in the coordination numbers CNs of O and Ti around the Ti center. The CNs of the TiO2 samples were determined through quantitative fitting of the FT-EXAFS curves Figure S27. When the potential goes from 0 V to 0.8 V, the CNs of TiO in the first shell decreases from 3.28 to 2.83, whereas the CNs of TiTi scattering path decreases from 1.23 to 0.97. This decrease in coordination, reflecting increased oxygen vacancy formation, coincides with the enhancement of cathodic current density and the development of macroscopic electrochromism in the catalyst Table S5. In addition, quasi- in situ XRD reveals a slight decrease in the lattice constant Figure S28, further confirming the increase in Ov during the electroreduction.

Therefore, the electrochromism is a macroscopic manifes- tation of low-valence-state, high-reducing-activity Ti3 species accompanied by Ov and hydrogen adsorption Hads at cathodic potentials. These active species play a crucial role in the activation process of nitrate reduction. The introduction of formaldehyde leads to competitive adsorption, which decreases the concentrations of Ov and Hads on the catalytic surface, resulting in a lighter color. Such a change would also lead to the formation of new active adsorbed species which will be discussed in detail below, thereby modulating the catalytic selectivity. Reaction Intermediates. In the process of electro- reduction from nitrate to ammonia, there may be over a dozen of reaction intermediates and surface-adsorbed species, including H, OH, NO2 , HNO3, NO, NOH, HNO, N, NH, NH2, NHOH, NH2O, NH2OH, N2O and NH3. To investigate the reaction pathway for the coreduction from HCHO and NO3 to formaldehyde oxime, DEMS was employed to detect reaction intermediates under different conditions Figure S29.43 The tests were conducted in an alkaline electrolyte containing KNO3 Figure 4d: 1 no DEMS signals were detected at open-circuit potential; 2 at 100 s, a potential of 0.8 V vs RHE was applied, and signals for mz 44, 30, and 17 were clearly identified, indicating the formation of N2O, NO and NH3; 3 at 420 s, formaldehyde was introduced, and the DEMS signal for NH3 rapidly diminished within 100 s, while the NO signal intensified further, and signals for HNO and NH2OH emerged, with the signal for NO2 mz 46 showing a first increasing and then decreasing trend. Yet the signal for N2O did not change. It is possible that there may exist other active sites that are not affected by formaldehyde. Furthermore, we explored the DEMS signals of intermediates Journal of the American Chemical Society pubs.acs.orgJACS Article https:doi.org10.1021jacs.5c03124 J. Am. Chem. Soc. XXXX, XXX, XXXXXX F in different electrolytes under various potentials using a pulsed potential sequence Figure S30. Before the potential reached 0.4 V, and the catalyst did not turn blue, no signals were detected. As the potential went from 0.5 V to 0.9 V, the signals for intermediates intensified, indicating the generation of more intermediates. Complementary experiments using 15N- labeled nitrate Figure S31 verified nitrate as the nitrogen source for the detected species. Furthermore, the key intermediate signals observed were consistent with those obtained in the nonlabeled DEMS experiments, validating the data set used for subsequent pathway analysis. Derived from these DEMS results, we propose the plausible reaction pathways for the NO3RR over rutile array Figure S32. Notably, during the nitrate reduction process, only trace amounts of HNO and NH2OH intermediates were detected. In contrast, under coreduction conditions, the signals for HNO and NH2OH were significantly stronger, with CH2NOH mz 45 also directly detected.

In contrast, under coreduction conditions, the signals for HNO and NH2OH were significantly stronger, with CH2NOH mz 45 also directly detected. If HCHO acts merely as a capturing agent for NH2OH intermediates to form form- aldehyde oxime, NH2OH would be rapidly consumed,44 and the signal for HNO would not exhibit a significant increase. Therefore, HCHO here may not only function simply as a capturing agent, but most likely also acts as a molecular tuning agent27 influencing the thermodynamic stability of intermedi- ates and the reaction kinetics of nitrate reduction through competitive adsorption with Hads and Ti5c on the rutile surface. This hypothesis is also corroborated by examining the effect of HCHO concentration Figure S14. We observed that the FE for CH2NOH exhibits a saturation at higher concentrations, while the overall yield rate follows a volcano-like trend owing to decreasing current density. Such a nonlinear and saturation kinetics is characteristic of surface-adsorption-mediated pro- cesses, providing strong evidence against the simple solution- phase trapping mechanism and supporting the role of formaldehyde as a surface modulator. Since DEMS detects the intermediates extracted from the near-surface region, its ability to observe specific intermediates depends on their surface kinetics and adsorption strength. Intermediates with very short lifetimes may not reach detectable steady-state concentrations, while strongly adsorbed intermediates may not desorb readily enough to be sampled, hindering their detection. This suggests that the pure nitrate reduction process might proceed at such a rapid pace that HNO, NO2, and NH2OH are not able to accumulate. The characteristics of strong adsorption and easy dissociation for NH2OH on the TiO2 surface hinder the detection via DEMS. In contrast, after the addition of formaldehyde, the surface modulation induced by formaldehyde lowered the nitrate reduction reaction rate, rendering the intermediates more readily detectable and facilitating the desorption of NH2OH. This promotes the carbonnitrogen coupling process from either the electric double layer in solution or the catalyst surface. Kinetics studies via operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy EIS also suggest disparate mechanisms in different electrolyte Figure S33, Supplementary Note 5. ATRFTIR spectroscopy further validated these mecha- nisms by directly identifying the intermediates. Notably, ATRFTIR spectroscopy detects surface-adsorbed species on the catalyst, rather than the desorbed species as detected using DEMS. In the NO3 reduction reaction Figure 4g, the peaks at 2852 cm1 and 2926 cm1 correspond to the formation of NH2OH,25 whereas the peak at 1457 cm1 is attributed to the bending vibration of NH2 Figure 4e, most likely resulting from NH4 formation. The peak at 3743 cm1 may correspond to νTiOH Figures S34, S35, indicating the generation of surface hydroxylated structures.45 These peaks gradually intensified as the potential went cathodic. In the system with formaldehyde added Figure 4f, a distinct C NO peak was detected at 1698 cm1 in the more negative potential range, arising from the coupling product H2C NOH46 or HCHO.

Moreover, the peaks characteristic of hydroxylamine disappeared Figure 4h, indicating efficient coupling of formaldehyde with NH2OH or rapid desorption of NH2OH. In contrast to the spectrum recorded in sole NO3 reduction, the νTiOH peak is absent here, confirming that the addition of aldehyde indeed lowered the surface hydrogen coverage, which competes for adsorption with protons. An additional peak emerged at 1429 cm1, which can be attributed to bidentate titanium-coordinated formaldehyde Ti2 OCH2O Figure S36.47 This surface-adsorbed species has been confirmed to be one of the key intermediates in the removal of formaldehyde in TiO2 during thermocatalysis, as have been evidenced via in situ scanning tunneling microscopy, infrared spectroscopy.48,49 In addition, we also explored the surface adsorbed species of rutile using quasi-in situ ssNMR Figure 4i. Notably, the rutile array sample synthesized using tertbutyl titanate as the precursor exhibits a significant amount of alkoxy-terminated TiOCH23CH3 structures on its surface, as indicated by the presence of methyl and methylene groups at 1.2 and 3.7 ppm, respectively.40 The potential- dependent Raman spectra show a gradual decrease in the intensity for the CH bond around 27603000 cm1 as the potential went cathodic Figure S37. This suggests that the alkoxy structure could be easily removed during electro- catalysis, carrying away surface bridge oxygen atoms, thereby generating more surface Ov than for commercial rutile catalysts. This is also the reason why the sample synthesized using liquid-phase synthesis method exhibits superior perform- ance compared to commercial rutile. After the reaction, the alkoxy-terminated structure disappears from the rutile surface, and a peak corresponding to the key adsorbed species Ti2 OCH2O emerges at 4.4 ppm.50 By examining the C 1s difference spectrum from quasi-in situ XPS Figures 4j and S38, we noticed that the signals for CHx and CO bonds increase significantly after the reaction, alongside a smaller increase for CON species. This indicates the presence of a bridged OCH2O structure with single-bond characteristics on the surface.51 On the basis of the studies involving electrochemistry, in situ XAS, ATR-FTIR, and DEMS, through cross-validation and analysis Figure S39, we conclude that the electrochemical reduction coupling of NO3 and HCHO occurs on the rutile surface, as illustrated in Figure 4k. Further kinetic insights were obtained from Tafel analysis. The experimental Tafel slope for NO3RR on the rutile array was determined to be 119.7 mVdec without formaldehyde, compared to 123.8 mVdec with HCHO addition Figure S40. These values imply that the first electron transfer step in the overall reaction sequence might be the rate-determining step RDS corresponding to a theoretical slope of 120 mVdec for n 1 electron transfer involved in the RDS. Notably, this kinetic behavior aligns with the concurrent onset of significant nitrate reduction currents and electrochromism indicating OvTi3 formation at potentials around 0.4 V Figures 4a, 2c, points toward a mechanism where",

This hypothesis could help explain a key seemingly contradictory observation: our rutile array, while being relatively inert for the hydrogen evolution reaction HER and having a poor intrinsic conductivity, exhibits anomalously rapid kinetics for nitrate reduction once a sufficient cathodic potential is applied. Conventional NO3RR pathways often rely heavily on efficient surface hydrogen H generation via water dissociation, which is expected to be sluggish on the HER-inert TiO2. Furthermore, the initial reduction of the stable NO3 into NO2 is generally considered as the bottleneck in conventional mechanisms. However, the rapid kinetics observed here, coupled with the Tafel slope suggesting Figure 5.

We propose this alternative mechanism is mediated by dynamically generated Ov, with surface Ob sites potentially assisting protonation for Ov formation. For the nitrate reduction process after the rate-limiting Ov generation step, the high density of these Ov sites could facilitate the insertion of oxygen from NO3 . This disrupts the high symmetry of the nitrate ion, impairing the relatively inert NO bond and leading to ultrafast nitrate reduction kinetics, and thus the NO3 to NO2 step is no longer the RDS here. In DEMS, NO2 intermediates were not detected, further confirming that the reduction from NO3 to NO occurs with a high efficiency.

In the presence of formaldehyde, HCHO competes for adsorption with H, thereby influencing the concentrations of Ti3 and Ov. Under electrochemical reduction conditions in aqueous solution, chemically adsorbed HCHO predominantly exists in a stable Ti5cOCH2Ob form. Through spatial effects and electronic modulation, this process constrains the kinetics of nitrate reduction and stabilizes the NH2OH intermediate, enabling efficient electrosynthesis of the coupling product CH2NOH across a wide potential range. Theoretical Investigations via DFT Calculations. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of nitrate electroreduction on the rutile surface and the potential regulating role of formaldehyde in this process, we conducted spin-polarized density functional theory DFT calculations on all possible pathways for the overall reaction. As electron microscopy characterizations and geometric analysis have shown in Figure 3b, the 110 plane is the exposed facet. Thus, the rutile 110 surface with a symmetric structure of Ti5c and Ob was constructed as the active surface. Given the complexity of the nitrate electroreduction mechanism on the TiO2 surface, we calculated the most stable adsorption configurations of all intermediates on the rutile surface as illustrated in Figures S41, S42 and systematically studied the evolution pathways of the active species in NO3RR Tables S6, S7. To validate our hypothesis regarding the RDS derived from Tafel analysis, we calculated the energetics for Ov formation on both an ideal rutile 110 surface and an OBu n-butanol- terminated model surface. The results detailed in Figure S43 revealed that the RDS for Ov generation on the OBu- terminated surface is indeed the initial electron transfer protonation step Step 1 in our proposed scheme, with a barrier of 0.64 eV. This finding strongly supports our interpretation of the experimental Tafel slope 120 mV dec and confirms that active site formation probably governs the overall reaction kinetics in our system. With the understanding that Ov generation is the kinetic bottleneck, we then used DFT to investigate the subsequent reaction pathway initiated by the facile activation of nitrate on these Ov sites. We explored the interaction of NO3 with the Ov-containing surface Figure 5a.53 Compared with bidentate adsorption of NO3 on Ti5c 0.11 eV, the oxygen atom in NO3 could more readily occupy the Ov site for recovery 0.32 eV.

In this process, the electrons previously stored at Ti3 could be released synchronously, resulting in an altered local charge density that activates the NO bond in the inserted NO3 , effectively cleaving NO3 to generate NO2 , while the recovered Ov now exists as OH. This step NO3 H NO2 OH is highly exothermic 1.95 eV, different from conventional mechanisms for nitrate electro- reduction where the activation of nitrate to nitrite occurs readily. This finding aligns well with the fact that NO2 intermediates could barely be detected in DEMS. Further, the NO2 adsorbed on Ti5c would rearrange into a bidentate adsorption ONOD configuration, followed by sequential H2O elimination to generate NO. This step has no significant thermodynamic barrier, featuring a gradual decrease in free energy. We then calculated the reaction pathway for reducing NO to NH3Figure 5b. NO would be preferentially reduced into NHO ΔG 0.05 eV rather than to NOH 0.445 eV. The conversion from NOH to N is even less favorable, thus establishing the basis for selective hydroxylamine production. Starting from NHO, NH3 could be produced via three pathways: 1 Protonation at the N end to form NH2OH, which then dissociates and undergoes H2O elimination to generate NH2. 2 Protonation at the N end to form NHOH, which undergoes H2O elimination to give NH, and then further protonated directly to NH2. 3 Protonation at the O end to form ONH2, which can either follow the NH2OH route via pathway 1 or proceed via the Langmuir Hinshelwood mechanism to directly yield ONH3 through a hydrogen atom transfer HAT process. For pathways 1 and 2, both reactions are exothermic and likely to occur, whereas pathway 3 ONH2 ONH3 has a small thermodynamic barrier ΔG 0.13 eV. To sum up, on the rutile 110 surface, nitrate electro- reduction is more likely to follow pathway 1 involving the key intermediate NH2OH. The selectivity between NH2OH and NH3 depends on the balance between the adsorption and dissociation of NH2OH. On pure rutile surfaces, NH2OH is more likely to dissociate 0.59 eV than to desorb 1.61 eV, making it rather difficult to detect NH2OH in DEMS, and therefore NH3 becomes the predominant detectable product. When formaldehyde is introduced, it adsorbs in the form of OCH2, generating the key adsorbate species Ti2OCH2O, which facilitates strong electron transfer at the TiO2 surface. Additionally, its adsorption site overlaps with the protonated Ob sites responsible for the electrochromism, leading to competitive adsorption, which explains the observed fading in electrochromism. The adsorbed HCHO significantly alters the electronic structure of the surface and affects the stability of various intermediates through intermolecular interactions. On the basis of these results, we calculated the energy landscape in the presence of the Ti2OCH2O species Figure 5c. Similar to the clean surface, the surface with formaldehyde is more likely to follow the NHO intermediate pathway, forming NHOH",

Remark- ably, the aldehyde intermediate stabilizes NH2OH, rendering it less likely to dissociate into NH2 OH, with a dissociation barrier of 1.27 eV.

This suggests that the key adsorbate species Ti2OCH2O, arising from competitive adsorption of aldehydes, effectively stabilizes the NH2OH intermediate, making it difficult to cleave, while allowing for easier desorption. This promotes the direct coupling with free HCHO, resulting in the formation of CH2NOH and significantly altering the product distribution to achieve a high selectivity for CH2NOH. Electro-reforming System. To achieve higher yields, enhanced energy efficiency, and lower the cost of electro- catalytic hydroxylamine production, we explored an electro- reforming route for hydroxylamine synthesis. Here form- aldehyde, in addition to being the molecular modulator and capturing agent for nitrate reduction as discussed above, also served as an energy carrier. Recently, copper-based materials have been shown to be a promising approach to achieve low- potential oxidation of aldehydes and through Tafel recombi- nation to produce hydrogen and formic acid under alkaline conditions,54 with a theoretical potential of only 0.22 V. Therefore, combining anodic FOR formaldehyde oxidation reaction with cathodic formaldehyde-mediated nitrate reduc- tion for hydroxylamine synthesis presents a thermodynamically more favorable strategy Figures 5d, S44, S45. This not only generates value-added anodic products such as H2 and HCOOH, but also significantly lowers the cell voltage input and maximizes the utilization of formaldehyde. We employed Cu3Ag7CF55 as the catalyst for aldehyde oxidation dehydro- genation and used rutile array as the catalyst for hydroxylamine synthesis Figure 5e. In comparison to the 2.3 V cell voltage required for the system with OER at the anode, our system with FOR at the anode only requires 0.78 V to achieve an industrial current density of 200 mA cm2 Figure 5f, while simultaneously producing hydroxylamine, formic acid, and hydrogen Figure S46. In the flow electrolyzer, the reaction system could operate stably at a current density of 200 mA cm2 for 10 h with almost no degradation in Faradaic efficiency for CH2NOH Figure S45c. Notably, the theoretical potential for nitrate-to-hydroxylamine conversion under alkaline con- ditions is 0.53 V vs RHE. By engineering electrocatalysts with lower overpotentials, the energy-consuming processes of nitrate electroreduction and formaldehyde electro-oxidation can be reconfigured into a formaldehyde-nitrate fuel cell that generates electrical energy, potentially achieving an open- circuit voltage",

With its superior energy conversion efficiency, we believe that our formaldehydenitrate coelectrolysis system holds great prom- ise for industrial-scale applications. SUMMARY In conclusion, we unveiled the reaction mechanism of nitrate electroreduction into hydroxylamine mediated by formalde- hyde on various phases and surfaces of TiO2, and identified Ti5cOb as the active center. The self-supported rutile array, predominantly exposing the 110 crystal facet, exhibits a remarkable catalytic activity, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 92.6 for CH2NOH and a yield of up to 2085 μmol cm2 h1. In addition, we found that the electrochromism of the catalyst is highly related to its catalytic activity. Specifically, this electrochromism manifests the dynamic generation of Ov and Ti3, the true active species that drive nitrate reduction via cycling processes involving Ob sites. Moreover, formaldehyde not only serves as a capturing agent but also as a molecular regulator, thereby enhancing the stability of the NH2OH intermediate and altering the reaction pathway to achieve selective reduction to give the target product. This work opens up a sustainable route to producing NH2OH under mild conditions through green electrochemistry and provides new insights into the selective regulation of nitrate reduction.

However, its interfacial structure and catalytic behavior remain poorly understood. Here we developed an integrated operando Raman spectroscopy and mass spectrometry MS method, to directly investigate the CO2 reduction mechanism at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface within a practical MEA electrolyzer operating at high current densities. Combined with isotope labeling experiments and ab initio molecular dynamics AIMD simulations, we provide, for the first time, the direct spectroscopic evidence of CCO, a crucial intermediate for C2 product formation, which has been frequently hypothesized but rarely detected in previous studies. By contrast, the linearly adsorbed COL intermediate, typically observed in conventional liquid electrolytes, was absent. These distinct behaviors arise from the unique structure of the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface, which shifts the rate-determining step from the usual C-C coupling to the CCO hydrogenation in the conversion of CO2 to C2 products. This study not only deepens our understanding of electrodepolyelectrolyte interfacial characteristics, but also offers valuable insights for advancing the performance of CO2 MEA electrolyzers.

At the heart of these technologies is the electrodeelectrolyte interface, where electrochemical reactions occur.7 A thorough exploration of the interfacial structure and its impact on electrochemical processes is thus essential.8 This understanding is crucial for the rational design of key materials, such as efficient electrode catalysts and electrolytes, and for advancing the performance of electrochemical technologies.9 Early electrochemical studies primarily relied on electrical signals for both excitation and detection, through applying varying potentialsvoltages or currents and observing the corresponding responses to probe the electrodeelectrolyte interface.10 Since the 1970s, the introduction of various spectroscopic techniques, such as electrochemical in-situ infrared and Raman spectroscopy, has enabled the acquisition of molecular- and atomic-scale information at the electrodeelectrolyte interface during electrochemical testing,1113 significantly deepening our understanding of electrochemical interfaces and reaction mechanisms. Nevertheless, it is important to note that most electrochemical in-situ spectroscopies developed to date focus on studying the electrodeliquid electrolyte interface. In contrast, modern electrochemical technologies increasingly employ polymer electrolytes i.e., polyelectrolytes instead of liquid electrolytes e.g., HClO4, KOH solution.14 This shift enables the construction of zero-gap membrane electrode assembly MEA devices, which help reduce internal resistance and thus improve electrochemical energy conversion efficiency.15 The inherent differences between polyelectrolytes and liquid electrolytessuch as variations in ionic species organic versus inorganic and ionic mobility bound versus freeinevitably result in significant differences in the microstructure and catalytic behavior at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface compared to the conventional electrodeliquid electrolyte interface. For instance, our recent studies have shown that CO2 reduction can occur at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface with immobilized organic cations, a reaction that is challenging to achieve in liquid electrolytes containing free organic cations.16,17 Additionally, to facilitate spectroscopic detection, these widely used in-situ spectroscopies 10.1002anie.202509423 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

These variations in operating conditions can even lead to markedly different catalytic behaviors.20,21 For instance, a previous study demonstrated that while the nonprecious Mn-Co catalyst shows inferior oxygen reduction reaction ORR performance compared to PtC in aqueous KOH electrolyte, this trend reverses in alkaline",

These variations in operating conditions can even lead to markedly different catalytic behaviors.20,21 For instance, a previous study demonstrated that while the nonprecious Mn-Co catalyst shows inferior oxygen reduction reaction ORR performance compared to PtC in aqueous KOH electrolyte, this trend reverses in alkaline polyelectrolyte fuel cells APEFCs with gas diffusion electrodes GDEs operating at 60C, due to differences in water content at the catalytic interfaces.22 Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop operando spectroscopic methods that are compatible with the operating conditions of MEA devices, to more accurately reveal the structural characteristics and catalytic behavior of the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface under practical working conditions. Indeed, some progress has been made in probing the interfaces within practical MEA-type fuel cells and water electrolyzers, through the combined use of techniques such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy XAS,23 near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy NAP-XPS,24,25 infrared spectroscopy,26,27 and Raman spectroscopy.28,29 However, operando studies focusing on CO2 MEA electrolyzers, particularly those operating in a polyelectrolytepure water medium without any liquid electrolytes, remain rather limited. In this study, we develop an integrated operando Raman spectroscopy and mass spectrometry MS method using the MEA configuration, to investigate CO2 reduction at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface. This approach allows for the simultaneous detection of interfacially adsorbed intermediates and volatile products such as CO, CH4, C2H4, C2H5OH, and others under industrial-scale current densities, providing molecular insights into the CO2 reduction mechanism in practical MEA electrolyzers. Notably, unlike the linearly adsorbed COL intermediate commonly observed in Cu-catalyzed CO2 reduction in KOH or KHCO3 aqueous electrolytes,30 we are surprised to find that COL is absent at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface.

Results and discussion To compare the CO2 reduction behavior at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface with that at the conventional electrodeliquid electrolyte interface, we developed two types of spectroelectrochemical cells.

The counter and reference electrodes were immersed in the electrolyte solution. The excitation laser passes through a quartz window and a thin layer of the electrolyte solution, allowing the Raman scattering signals at the electrodeliquid electrolyte interface to be collected Figure S3a. Although this GDE- based setup significantly enhances CO2 mass transport and allows for electrochemical testing at current densities exceeding 100 mAcm2, the high internal resistance between the working and counter electrode, due to their large separation distance, makes operation at higher current densities challenging. Additionally, at higher current densities 300 mAcm2, vide infra, a large number of gas bubbles will form on the electrode surface, which can severely interfere with Raman signal collection. Figure 1b and Figure S4 illustrate the operando Raman-MS cell designed in this study, based on the zero-gap MEA configuration. In this setup, the cathode was fabricated using the catalyst-coated membrane CCM process, in which the Cu nanocatalyst and QAPEEK ionomer molecular structure shown in Figure 1b were ultrasonically mixed and spray-coated onto an alkaline polyelectrolyte membrane QAPPT, Figure S5 to form the cathode Details in 10.1002anie.202509423 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

An IrO2-coated Ti anode was tightly pressed against the opposite side of the QAPPT membrane. A hydrophobic carbon paper with pre-drilled small holes 100 μm, Figure S6 was used as the gas diffusion layer, and a quartz optical window was installed at the cathode flow field. This design allows the excitation laser with a spot diameter of approximately 1 μm to pass through the flow field and small holes, reaching the cathode catalyst layer for Raman signal collection Figure S3b. Notably, the cathodic incidence detection can effectively eliminate the interference of fluorescence signals from alkaline polyelectrolyte membranes e.g., QAPPT in this study, which typically contain a large number of conjugated benzene-ring structures. In addition to the Raman characterization, a capillary sampling port was introduced at the cathode outlet for MS analysis. This setup enables the collection of reaction intermediate information at the cathode interface by Raman and the simultaneous analysis of corresponding volatile products by MS for the CO2 MEA electrolyzer under its normal operating conditions.

Testing at higher current densities was limited due to interference from gas bubbles, as mentioned above. The obtained spectra are consistent with those reported in the literature,34,35 displaying some characteristic vibrational bands. The bands at around 280 cm1, 360 cm1, and 2060 cm1 correspond to the frustrated rotation, Cu-CO stretching, and C-O stretching of linearly adsorbed COL, respectively,3638 which is generally considered a key intermediate for CO2 deep reduction into CH4 as well as C2 products e.g., C2H4, C2H5OH.39 The band at 526 cm1 is attributed to surface Cu-OH species.40,41 The bands at 1015 cm1 and 1070 cm1 correspond to the HCO3 and CO32, respectively,42,43 with their relative intensity reflecting the local pH near the electrode surface. The band at 1386 cm1 can be assigned to the C-O vibration of COOH intermediate.44,45 Additionally, the bands at 1600 cm1 and 3000- 3600 cm1 are associated with the bending δH2O and stretching νO-H vibration of interfacial water, respectively.46,47 Figure 2b shows the operando Raman spectra for CO2 reduction at the CuQAPEEK i.e., electrodepolyelectrolyte interface across current densities ranging from 50 to 700 mAcm2, obtained using the MEA setup illustrated in Figure 1b.

This band at 460 cm1 is distinct from both Cu-COL and Cu-OH species and likely consists of two different vibrations or species, as indicated by its asymmetric peak 10.1002anie.202509423 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

The local pH values for the two systems under different current densities were calculated using the CO32HCO3 integral area ratio and the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation Figure S9, Note 1,50 revealing a higher pH at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface.

Another significant observation is the complete disappearance of the νO-H band at the CuQAPEEK interface Figure 2b, 2f. This can be attributed to two factors: first, the reduced water content at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface due to the presence of the hydrophobic backbone of QAPEEK; and second, the preservation of a strong hydrogen bonding network within the water at this interface, due to the inability of the polyelectrolyte-tethered organic cations to form a compact double layer under negative potentials, as found in our previous study.17 There is a broad consensus that Raman spectroscopy is insensitive to water, but recent research suggests that the disruption of hydrogen bonding network is critical for detecting water vibrations via surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.51 This explains why the νO-H band can be detected at the electrodeliquid electrolyte interface Cu1 M KHCO3, Figure 2a, whereas it cannot be detected at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface CuQAPEEK, Figure 2b. To identify these specific species and their formation mechanism, as well as examine their relevance to CO2 reduction at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface, various CO2 reduction volatile products, including CO, CH4, C2H4, and C2H5OH, were simultaneously monitored in real-time using the operando MS technique Figure 1b, alongside Raman measurement. The yields of these products generally exhibited an increasing trend with rising current densities Figure 3a. Figure 3b presents the average ion currents of these products at different current densities, while Figure 3c displays the integral areas of the unidentified band at 1945 cm1. Notably, as the current density increased, there was a strong correlation between the generation rate of C2 products C2H4 and C2H5OH and the peak intensity at 1945 cm1. Both showed a synchronized changing profile, which was different from the generation rates of CO and CH4. This suggests that the band at 1945 cm1 likely corresponds to a key intermediate involved in the C2 products formation. Furthermore, the correlation between the generation rates of these volatile products and the COB peak intensity is minimal Figure S10, supporting claims in the literature that COB acts as a surface inactive poisoning species and cannot undergo subsequent reduction.48 10.1002anie.202509423 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

To identify the newly detected species at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface, we conducted isotopic experiments employing 13C- and D-labelling Figure 4a-4c, Figure S11. The 12CO213CO2 exchange resulted in a noticeable redshift of the Raman bands at 1945 cm1, 1834 cm1, 460 cm1, and 353 cm1 Figure 4b, 4c. In contrast, these bands exhibited negligible shifts in the H2OD2O isotope exchange, indicating that the corresponding species contain carbon but no hydrogen. Specifically, the band shift from 1834 cm1 to 1793 cm1 aligns well with the estimated value for COB Supporting Note 2. For the unidentified band at 1945 cm1, which is associated with C2 products formation, a redshift from 1945 cm1 to 1913 cm1 was observed during the 12CO213CO2 exchange. Previous studies have suggested that the vibration bands in the 19002000 cm1 range may correspond to two adjacent adsorbed CO in the co-existence of OH,52 multi-bound CO,53 or CCO.54 However, based on the band shift value noted in the isotope experiments, we can rule out the possibility that this band corresponds to surface-adsorbed CO species Supporting Note 2. On the other hand, CCO is often regarded as an intermediate in the conversion of CO2 to C2 products.

Our analysis indicates that both the isotope-induced band shifts from 1945 cm1 to 1913 cm1 and from 460 cm1 to 453 cm1 are consistent well with two vibration modes of the CCO Supporting Note 2, and the changes in the integral areas of the two peaks also show a strong correlation as the current density increases Figure 2b, S12. Moreover, the band at 1945 cm1 is also quite closely matched to that of the CCO molecule in the gas phase.57,58 According to our further AIMD calculations Figure S13, the band at 1945 cm1 can be assigned to the asymmetric stretching vibration, while the band at 460 cm1 corresponds to the bending vibration of CCO.

See the Terms and Conditions https:onlinelibrary.wiley.comterms-and-conditions on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 12 Based on the results mentioned above and the CO2 reduction pathways hypothesized in previous studies,31 the unusual CO2 reduction reaction pathways at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface i.e., CuQAPEEK can be schematically illustrated in Figure 4d. The high local pH at this interface Figure S9, generally believed to facilitate C-C coupling,59,60 leads to the rapid consumption and conversion of active COL. This explains why COL is not observed in operando Raman spectra. Moreover, in the preceding steps for CCO generation, protonation primarily occurs at the highly electronegative oxygen Oδ site rather than at carbon Cδ, for example, as seen in the step of COOH formation. Due to the restricted mobility of polyelectrolyte-tethered organic cations, a rigid hydrogen bonding network is maintained at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface under negative potentials, with a high proportion of strongly hydrogen-bonded water sh-H2O. It is reasonable to infer that the Hδ in sh-H2O can readily interact with the Oδ in these oxygen-containing intermediates, facilitating direct protonation with interfacial water via the Eley-Rideal mechanism.61 However, for the further conversion of CCO, the protonation of α-C to form CHCO is thermodynamically more favorable.62 To elucidate the protonation process of CCO, we conducted density functional theory DFT calculations. The calculations demonstrate that the protonation of α-C atom via the Eley- Rideal mechanismwhere CCO reacts with dangling water molecules above the electrode surfaceis not feasible, restricted by the substantial spatial separation between them. Instead, due to the proximity of the α-C atom to the electrode surface, the only viable pathway for this protonation process follows the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, where the reaction occurs with surface-adsorbed water H2O, Figure S14. Nonetheless, this pathway still needs to overcome a relatively high transition-state energy barrier of 0.89 eV Figure 4e. In addition, due to the low water content and the constraint imposed by the rigid hydrogen bonding network at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface, the transport and adsorption of water molecules onto the electrode surface are significantly limited. Consequently, the conversion rate of CCO to CHCO is relatively slow, allowing the Raman detection of the CCO intermediate. This also explains the absence of Cu-OH species 526",

Overall, the distinct electrodepolyelectrolyte interfacial structure shifts the rate-determining step from the usual C- C coupling to the CCO hydrogenation in the conversion of CO2 to C2 products. Conclusions In summary, we have investigated the CO2 reduction mechanism at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface within a practical MEA electrolyzer by combining operando Raman and MS analyses. We successfully captured direct spectroscopic evidence of a key CCO intermediate for C2 products formation, which was further verified through 13C- and D- isotopic substitution experiments as well as AIMD calculations. Notably, the CCO intermediate has been rarely detected in previous studies on CO2 reduction in conventional liquid electrolytes. This observation is due to the distinct structural characteristics of the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface, including a relatively high local pH, lower water content, and a more rigid hydrogen bonding network in the interfacial water. These features favor the Eley-Rideal type hydrogenation and disfavor the Langmuir-Hinshelwood type hydrogenation in CO2 reduction, thus promoting the conversion of surface-active COL to CCO while limiting its further protonation. These findings can not only facilitate the design of efficient electrocatalytic interfaces in practical MEA electrolyzers for CO2 and pure water co-electrolysis, but also highlight the importance of developing operando spectroscopic methods for studying interfacial catalysis under MEA working conditions. Further efforts can be made to introduce a stable and reliable reference electrode into the MEA device, in order to probe changes in interfacial species at different electrode potentials, rather than just observing their variations relative to current densities. Although some studies have attempted this, eliminating the measurement errors resulting from non-uniform currentpotential distributions still poses a challenge.65,66 10.1002anie.202509423 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

Herein, we propose a phosphorus P-doping mediation strategy to introduce an oxygen vacancy into the Cu2O lattice, resulting in a C2 Faradaic efficiency of 87.0 at a partial current density of 347.8 mAcm2. Mechanistic studies unveil that P dopants dynamically regulate the formation of high-density oxygen vacancies in Cu2O lattices through the formation and subsequent detachment of the PO bond, predominantly in the form of phosphite within an aqueous electrolyte environment. In situ Raman spectroscopy coupled with density functional theory calculations further reveals that the OV-rich structure optimizes the surface coverage of active CO intermediates. This microenvironment not only accelerates the energetically favorable CC coupling pathway but also suppresses competitive protonation reactions, thereby breaking the intrinsic activity-selectivity trade-off. Our work provides atomic-level insights into defect dynamics manipulation for designing high-rate CO2 conversion systems. KEYWORDS: oxygen vacancy, P-doping mediation, CO2 reduction reaction, CO intermediate, multicarbon products INTRODUCTION The excessive use of fossil fuels at the expense of increasing global carbon emissions has caused irreversible climatic changes. The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction CO2RR, which converts CO2 into high-value-added and easily storable chemical energy, is an environmentally friendly approach with the potential to alleviate the energy crisis.1 Cu- based electrocatalysts have garnered significant attention due to the optimal CO binding energy on the Cu surface, facilitating CC coupling to C2 products. Up until now, a substantial number of researches have made considerable developments of Cu-based electrocatalysts through various strategies, including doping,24 ligand modification,57 do- main-limited space construction,8,9 and defects engineer- ing.1012 However, the sluggish kinetics and high CC coupling energy barrier of the CO2RR process, which involves multiple proton-coupled electron transfer, require high over- potential, leading to low selectivity C2 products. The creation of oxygen vacancies OVs is an effective strategy for the above issues, boosting the CO2RR performance by concurrently modifying the electronic structure and surface reactivity.13 The OVs, serving as fingerprint of the electronic structure of the catalysts, can effectively promote the transfer of electrons to the adsorbed CO2, thus lowering the energy barrier for CO2 electroreduction by enhancing CO2 activation and the adsorption of key intermediates.14,15 Second, it has been demonstrated that the presence of OVs enhances the charge transfer efficiency at the catalytic reaction interface by decreasing the charge transfer resistance, thus increasing the electrocatalytic reaction rate.15,16 Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that OVs can effectively suppress competitive HER activity by modulating the adsorption energy and electronic configuration of CO2RR intermediaries.17 Thus, it is of significant importance to develop Cu-based catalysts enriched with OVs. Nevertheless, the concentration and distribution of OVs exhibit",

Nevertheless, the concentration and distribution of OVs exhibit high sensitivity to the synthesis conditions such as temperature,18 pressure,19 and gas composition.20 This sensitivity makes it challenging to achieve precise and reproducible control of OVs.21 In addition, despite Received: March 17, 2025 Revised: May 24, 2025 Accepted: May 27, 2025 Article www.acsnano.org XXXX American Chemical Society A https:doi.org10.1021acsnano.5c04602 ACS Nano XXXX, XXX, XXXXXX Downloaded via TSINGHUA UNIV on June 15, 2025 at 12:43:38 UTC. See https:pubs.acs.orgsharingguidelines for options on how to legitimately share published articles. the overall CO2RR being a reductive process, the presence of CO2 and potential intermediate products can generate a relatively oxidizing microenvironment. Oxygen in CO2 or other oxygen-containing species may fill the OVs, reducing their concentration and affecting the catalytic activity.22 When the partial pressure of CO2 is high, the probability of oxygen filling the vacancies increases. Therefore, these factors pose critical challenges for precise synthesis of Cu-based catalyst enriched OVs, as well as maintaining long-term stability in a desired state for optimal catalytic performance. Herein, we proposed a P-doping mediation strategy to precisely control the formation of OVs, combining the one- step liquid-phase method to obtain a surface P-doped Cu2O as-prepared PCu2O at room temperature and the in situ electrochemical pre-reduction process to achieve the successful construction of OVs OVsCu2O. The P-dopant is the key factor for the rapid formation of substantial OVs in the Cu2O lattice, primarily through the formation and subsequent detachment of PO bonds. The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy UPS demonstrates that the OVs function as charge carriers, thereby facilitating electron transfer during the CO2RR. In situ Raman analysis indicates that the presence of OVs enhances the adsorption of CO intermediates, thus promoting the selectivity for C2 products. As a result, the OVsCu2O electrocatalysts achieved a C2 Faradaic efficiency FE of 87.0 at partial current density of 347.8 mAcm2, along with stable performance exceeding 30 h in a membrane electrode assembly MEA electrolyzer. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Synthesis and Characterization. The OVsCu2O catalysts were synthesized through a two-step process involving P-doping follow by an in situ electrochemical reduction process Figures 1a and S1. Due to the significant electronegativity difference between P 2.19 and O 3.44, the electron cloud of P with electron-donating ability tends to shift toward O.23 This leads to a strong binding tendency between P and O, thereby facilitating the formation of PO bonds. The second- step of the in situ electrochemical reduction process plays a crucial role in accelerating the detachment of PO bonds, leading to the departure of O atoms from the Cu2O lattice and thus forming OVs to obtain OVsCu2O.24,25 The PO bonds desorb as P-containing species from the catalyst surface into the electrolyte such as phosphate, phosphite, or hypophos- phite in an aqueous electrolyte.

The XRD patterns exhibit the distinctive diffraction peaks of as-prepared PCu2O and reference Cu2O Figure 1e, which index well to the Cu2O phase JCPDS 05-0667. Notably, compared with the reference Cu2O, the diffraction peaks of as-prepared P Cu2O exhibit a slight shift toward a lower angle Figure 1f, which is possibly caused by the introduction of P.26,27 Additionally, the Cu LMM spectra confirm the presence of Cu in both as-prepared PCu2O and reference Cu2O Figure 1g. These characterization results collectively indicate the successful synthesis of both PCu2O and reference Cu2O. In the second step, the as-prepared PCu2O and reference Cu2O undergo an in situ electrochemical reduction process pre-reduction process to obtain Cu2O enrich OVs OVs Cu2O and pre-reduced reference Cu2O. Scanning electron microscopy SEM and TEM images reveal that both the OVsCu2O Figures S2c,d and S5a and pre-reduced reference Cu2O Figure S3c,d nanoparticles exhibit increased particle sizes and display similar morphologies. The EDS elemental maps of the OVsCu2O clearly demonstrate the depletion of P during the pre-reduction process Figure S5b, which aligns with our anticipated catalyst design objectives and exhibits a compositional profile similar to that of the pre- reduced reference Cu2O. Moreover, the quasi-in situ XRD spectra revealed that, after the pre-reduction process, a fraction of Cu2O in both OVsCu2O and the pre-reduced reference Cu2O transformed into Cu Figure S6.

To further investigate the relationship between PO bonds formation, PO bonds detachment, and the rapid, extensive OVs formation, a series of comprehensive characterization analyses were conducted. According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS characterization analysis, the peak located at 133.18 eV in the P 2p spectra is ascribed to the PO bonds Figure 2.

Correspond- ingly, a significant number of OVs were simultaneously formed on the surface of OVsCu2O following the pre-reduction process, as evidenced by the analysis of the O 1s spectrum. The three peaks detected at 530.15, 531.38, and 532.85 eV of the OVsCu2O are attributed to lattice oxygen Olatt, OVs, and adsorbed oxygen Oads,3032 respectively Figure 2b. A comparison between the as-prepared PCu2O and OVs Cu2O samples indicates that the OVsCu2O catalysts possess the highest concentration of OVs Table S1. To provide direct evidence of the construction of OVs during the pre- reduction process, in situ electron paramagnetic resonance EPR characterization was performed at a constant current of 5.0 mA. The result demonstrated that the persistence of OVs during the pre-reduction process and the concentration increased with the extension of the reduction time, which preliminarily confirmed the mechanism of OVs formation Figure 2c. Furthermore, quasi-in situ EPR was performed for the PCu2O and the reference Cu2O catalysts. Compared to the as-prepared PCu2O and reference Cu2O catalysts Figure 2f, both the OVsCu2O and the OVsCu2O after CO2RR exhibit a more pronounced signal peak at g 2.003 Figure 2e. Moreover, the catalysts after the CO2RR were characterized by XPS, and the O 1s spectra are displayed in Figure S7.

This is attributed to the electronegativity of P 2.19, which is larger than that of Cu 1.90, thus resulting the charge transfer between Cu atoms and P atoms.26 The phenomenon of electron transfer can also be verified from the Cu 2p spectra. The peaks located at 932.99 and 952.78 eV are attributed to Cu 2p32 and Cu 2p12 of Cu or Cu0, respectively Figure S8. With the introduction of P, the binding energies of Cu 2p32 and 2p12 have a significant positive shift, which further identifies the effect of electron transfer on the surface of the electrocatalysts.36 In contrast, the peak position of Cu 2p32 and 2p12 of the OVsCu2O has a clear negative shift, which may be due to the transfer of hole electrons on the OVs, thus leading Cu atoms in an electron-rich state.18,37,38 Due to the unavoidable partial oxidation of the samples during the delivery process, shoulder peaks of Cu2 are observed at 934.70 and 955.08 eV.12 The P-containing species in the electrolyte were subsequently characterized using ion chroma- tography IC. The results indicate that the majority of the detached P exists in the electrolyte primarily as phosphite Figures S9S11 and Table S2, which is consistent with the presence of PO bonds observed in the P 2p spectrum of the as-prepared PCu2O. All characterization results unambigu- ously confirm that the introduction of P and the construction of OVs can effectively engineer the charge redistribution, thereby facilitating CO2 activation.

To gain further insights into the mechanism by which P dopants mediate the formation of OVs, we conducted density functional theory DFT calculations. According to the experimental characterizations, Cu2O200 was selected to study the effects of P dopant on the OVs formation. The pristine Cu2O200 and its corresponding P-doped models are shown Figure 2g. The OVs formation energy ΔEOVs,formation was employed to describe the tendency of OVs formation caused by P dopants, which was defined by ΔEOVs,formation EOVs EO EnPCu d2O200, where EOVs and EnPCu d2O200 represented the electronic energy of the P-doped models with and without OVs, respectively. EO was calculated from EH d2O and EH d2 EH d2O EH d2. The more negative the ΔEOVs,formation, the more likely to form OVs over Cu2O. Figure 2d demonstrates that the ΔEOVs,formation exhibits a tendency to decrease with an increase in the PCu ratio of the surface phase, suggesting that P dopants can contribute to the generation of OVs. When the ratio of PCu approaches to 0.6, the ΔEOVs,formation is demonstrably lower than that of pristine Cu2O, indicating that higher P dopant level is more likely to form OVs compared to pristine Cu2O. Moreover, the ratio of PCu in the surface phase of PCu2O, as determined by XPS Table S3, falls within the higher PCu ratio interval 0.5 to 0.7. Theoretical calculations further indicate that a higher concentration of P dopants can change the surface configuration of PCu2O, especially the oxygen coordination environments, for example, PO and CuO bonds, which would contribute to the formation of OVs during pre- reduction process Figure S12. Consequently, experimental characterizations in conjunction with DFT calculations indicate that the P-doped Cu2O catalyst facilitated the expeditious and extensive formation of OVs during the pre- reduction process. Electrocatalytic Performance in Flow Cell and MEA. The CO2RR activity of OVsCu2O and pre-reduced reference Cu2O catalysts was evaluated in a flow cell with 1.0 M KHCO3 electrolyte. Figure 3a shows the linear sweeping voltammetry LSV curve of OVsCu2O and pre-reduced reference Cu2O in CO2 and N2 atmospheres. Notably, under a CO2 atmosphere, the total current density of OVsCu2O was significantly higher than that of pre-reduced reference Cu2O at applied potentials lower than 1.2 V vs AgAgCl, indicating the enhanced CO2RR activity attributed to the presence of OVs. Given that the majority of the detached P primarily exists in the electrolyte as phosphite, to eliminate the potential interference of phosphite on the CO2RR performance, the electrolyte is completely drained following the pre-reduction step and subsequently replaced with fresh electrolyte for the subsequent CO2RR tests. As expected, no significant difference in the CO2RR performance was observed Table S4, which further corroborates that the activity enhancement of OVs Cu2O is attributable to the OVs. As illustrated in Figure 3b,c, OVsCu2O demonstrates a significantly higher selectivity for C2 products, including C2H4, C2H5OH, CH3COOH, and C3H7OH, compared to the pre-reduced reference Cu2O.

To be specific, the FEC2 of OVsCu2O electrode exceeds 80.0 in a broad current density range of 350 450 mAcm2 and reaches a topmost FEC d2 of 87.0 at a partial current density of 347.8 mAcm2, with 46.1 for FEC d2H d4 and 31.5 for FEC d2H d5OH. In comparison, the pre-reduced reference Cu2O exhibits lower selectivity, with the maximum FE for C2 products reaching only 63.1, whereas the FE for CO remains consistently above 20. Furthermore, the FEC2 Figure 3d and C2 partial current density Figure 3e of OVsCu2O are significantly higher than those of the pre-reduced reference Cu2O across the entire potential range. Especially, at a current density of 450 mA cm2, the value of FEC d2C d1 reaches 12.0, which is over- whelmingly superior to pre-reduced reference Cu2O Figure 3f. Moreover, a comparison has been made between OVs Cu2O and the currently available catalysts Table S5. The results demonstrate that OVsCu2O displays both excellent C2 product selectivity and partial current density in near- neutral electrolytes. Furthermore, to verify the modulation mechanism of P-doping-induced OVs construction on CO2RR performance, a series of PCu2O catalysts with different P doping concentrations were obtained by adjusting the addition of P source during the synthesis process. The feeding versus corresponding ICP-verified CuP ratios in the freshly prepared PCu2O catalysts revealed that the P-doping concentration increased progressively with a higher P precursor dosage until reaching saturation as the feeding molar ratio reached 1.5:1 Table S6. Subsequently, the EPR characterization of the series of OVs-rich Cu catalysts obtained by the pre-reduction treatment of PCu2O samples was conducted. The results revealed that the OVs concentration gradually increased with growing P-doping concentration Figure S13. Notably, the CO2RR product analysis of the OVs-enriched Cu catalysts indicated that the FEC2 exhibited an upward trend with increasing P-doping concentrations, while the competing C1 and H2 byproducts decreased inversely Figure S14. These findings substantiate that P-doping modulates the OVs concentration, providing further insights into the mechanism of P-doping-mediated OVs formation. Long-term electro- chemical stability is a critical parameter that significantly influences the performance of CO2RR.

This CO2RR- induced process leads to a reconfiguration of the local charge distribution surrounding the OVs, thereby causing a time- dependent decay in the concentration of OVs. As illustrated in Figure S15, the presence of OVs in OVsCu2O remains evident after a 30 h CO2RR stability test, implying the stability of the OVs in Cu2O catalysts. Mechanistic Study. We conducted a series of character- izations to further elucidate the mechanism of OVs in enhancing the CO2RR activity. The electrochemically active surface area ECSA usually affects CO2RR activity, which was measured by double-layer capacitance Cdl on the basis of cyclic voltammograms for the OVsCu2O and pre-reduced reference Cu2O Figure S16. It is evident that the ECSA values of the two electrocatalysts are relatively similar Figure S17, indicating that ECSA is not a primary factor influencing the difference in the CO2RR performance. Usually, the interfacial properties of the electrode and electrolyte also affect the CO2RR process. Therefore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed on the electrocatalysts at open circuit potential OCP, and Nyquist plots were obtained for both OVsCu2O and pre-reduced reference Cu2O electrocatalysts. The OVsCu2O exhibits a lower charge transfer resistance Rct, which facilitates enhanced interfacial charge transfer kinetics during the CO2RR process Figure S18. To explore the origin of the fast kinetics and excellent CO2RR activity of OVsCu2O, UPS measurement was carried out to evaluate its electron-donating ability. The work function, which is obtained from the UPS spectra according to the equation: Eφ hα Ecutoff EFermi,39 of the OVsCu2O 3.68 eV is significantly smaller than that of the pre-reduced reference Cu2O 4.34 eV Figure 4a, suggesting that the OVs decrease the energy barrier of electrons from the electrocatalyst surface to the reactants and intermediates during the CO2RR process.40 Furthermore, the valence band of the catalyst can be obtained without bias, as shown in Figure 4b, and the valence band position of OVsCu2O is 1.87 eV, which is closer to the Fermi energy level than that of the pre-reduced reference Cu2O 2.08 eV.

    "text": "absorption of the intermediates on the electrocatalyst surface could be intensified.18,41 The in situ Raman spectroscopy was employed to provide further insights into the adsorption behavior of the CO intermediate over the electrocatalysts during the CO2RR Figures 4c and S19. At OCP, both OVsCu2O and pre- reduced reference Cu2O catalysts exhibit two main Raman peaks at 524 and 625 cm1, which correspond to the signature peaks of Cu2O.4244 As the potential increased to 0.7 V vs AgAgCl, a distinct CuCO bond stretching vibration peak was observed at approximately 365 cm1, which demonstrate the appearance of CO intermediates on OVsCu2O electrode during CO2RR.4547 In comparison, the pre-reduced reference Cu2O exhibited a notably lower peak intensity of CuCO species within the same energy range, indicating an enhanced capacity for CO generation on the OVsCu2O electrode. Meanwhile, the characteristic CuCO peaks of the pre-reduced reference Cu2O only emerged when the voltage was increased to 1.3 V vs AgAgCl, which is more negative than the onset potential for CO adsorption on OVsCu2O. Furthermore, these peaks disappeared at 1.7 V vs AgAgCl, a potential that is more positive compared to the disappearance potential of CO adsorption on OVsCu2O 1.8 V vs Ag AgCl. The adsorption of CO on the OVsCu2O over a wide potential range from 0.7 V to 1.7 V vs AgAgCl further suggests that OVs facilitate the adsorption of CO intermediate to promote CC coupling and improve the selectivity of C2 products.48,49 In addition, electrochemical CO stripping voltammetry was employed to evaluate and compare the CO desorption performance of OVsCu2O and pre-reduced reference Cu2O. A pronounced CO stripping profile with a prominent peak at approximately 0.12 V vs Ag AgCl was observed for OVsCu2O Figure S20, while the corresponding peak for pre-reduced reference Cu2O appeared at around 0.03 V vs AgAgCl. The positive shift indicates a stronger CO adsorption on the OVsCu2O electrode, which is consistent with the conclusion of the in situ Raman experiments.50,51 CC coupling is usually considered as the rate-determining step in the conversion of CO2 to C2 products. Extensive research has shown that this process can be more effectively initiated by enhancing the adsorption of the key intermediate CO. To further substantiate the impact of OVs on the adsorption of CO, we conducted DFT calculations. First, the calculated binding energies of CO on Cu2O200 and Cu2O2004OV four OV sites over the surface are 0.94 eV and 1.61 eV Figure 4d, respectively, suggesting that the presence of OVs intensifies the adsorption of CO on the OVsCu2O electrode, which is in agreement with the above-mentioned in situ Raman and CO stripping results. Furthermore, the results of the Bader charge analysis indicate that the OVs enhance the charge transferred from Cu to CO adsorbed on Cu2O2004OV in comparison with Cu2O200, thus strengthening the adsorption of CO, which is conducive to subsequent CC coupling. Then, DFT calculations were performed to analyze the Gibbs free energy ΔG evolution of the CO2RR process. Based on the experimental results, it is known that almost all of",

Then, DFT calculations were performed to analyze the Gibbs free energy ΔG evolution of the CO2RR process. Based on the experimental results, it is known that almost all of the Cu2O material was reduced into metallic Cu during the pre-reduced process, so the fully reduced Cu2O200 with massive OVs, obtained by removing all of the O atoms from Cu2O200, was used for the subsequent CO2RR analysis. As a comparison, the CO2RR over the pristine Cu2O200 was also analyzed to study the effect of OVs on the crucial CC coupling step. The optimized configurations for the adsorption of different intermediates are displayed Figure S21. As depicted in Figure 4e, we found that the generation energy barrier of OCCO is 1.11 eV on fully reduced Cu2O200, which is noticeably lower than 1.73 eV observed on Cu2O200. The energy reduction from Cu2O200 to fully reduced Cu2O- 200 reveals that the presence of OVs facilitates CC coupling, further promoting CO2 conversion to C2 products. Additionally, the effects of OVs induced by P dopants on the reduction of C2 intermediates were further analyzed Figures S22 and S23, which revealed that the OVs can contribute to the generation of gaseous C2H4 and liquid products CH3CH2OH by decreasing the energy difference between CHCHO and CHCOH intermediates. In combination with the CO coupling Figure 4e, it is found that the limiting step for the generation of C2 products on Cu2O200 is from the CC coupling process, while OVs improve the CC coupling step, and the limiting step on fully reduced Cu2O200 is from the hydrogenation of the C2 intermediate OCCOH H eHOCCOH. Therefore, OVs modulate the electrochemical process to change the distribu- tion of C2 products, as reflected in Figure 3. CONCLUSIONS In summary, our work presents a catalyst enriched with OVs to achieve a high selectivity of 87.0 at a partial current density of 347.8 mAcm2 and stability over 30 h for the CO2RR toward C2 products. The experimental results, in situ characterization and DFT calculations provide solid evidence that the introduction of OVs enable selective adsorptionactivation of CO2 and reduction of energy barriers for CO2RR, thus promoting CC coupling and enhancing the selectivity of C2 products. These findings hold promise for providing clear insights into the production of OVs on Cu-based catalysts and developing a highly selective catalyst design strategy to boost the CO2RR activity. METHODS AND EXPERIMENTS Synthesis of OVsCu2O and Pre-reduced Reference Cu2O. The synthesis OVsCu2O catalysts were done through a two-step method involving P-doping followed by in situ electrochemical reduction process. First, the PCu2O electrocatalyst was synthesized by a one-step liquid-phase method at room temperature. Specifically, 0.1 g of CuCl22H2O and 0.04 g of NaH2PO2 were dissolved in 10 mL of DI water to form a light blue solution. Then, 10 mL of 0.09 M NaBH4 solution was added dropwise to the above mixture under vigorous stirring. The color of the solution",

Then, 10 mL of 0.09 M NaBH4 solution was added dropwise to the above mixture under vigorous stirring. The color of the solution changed from light blue to brownish brown, followed by stirring for 2 h at room temperature and washing with isopropanol and DI water alternately to remove residual impurities. The samples collected via centrifugation were freezedried to obtain a PCu2O powder. The reference Cu2O can be obtained by replacing sodium hypophosphite as the phosphorus source with HCOONa. Subsequently, the samples were pre-reduced for 180 s at a constant current of 50 mA to obtain OVsCu2O and pre-reduced reference Cu2O catalysts. Electrochemical Measurements. All electrochemical perform- ance measurements and LSV were conducted in a flowing cell GOSREL, Cp10 with an active area of 1 1 cm2. The flow cell comprises a gas flow chamber, a cathode chamber, and an anode chamber, which are separated by an anion exchange membrane Fumasep-FAB-PK-130. The gas diffusion electrode GDE acts as the cathode, serving as a separator between the gas chamber and the cathode chamber. The GDE was prepared as follows: Initially, 8 mg of electrocatalyst was dispersed in 5 mL of isopropanol and 10 μL of ACS Nano www.acsnano.org Article https:doi.org10.1021acsnano.5c04602 ACS Nano XXXX, XXX, XXXXXX G Nafion solution. Then, the mixture was dispersed by sonication for 30 min to form a homogeneous ink. At last, the ink was sprayed to a 3 3 cm2 gas diffusion layer with a theoretical electrocatalyst loading of 0.88 mg cm2. The prepared working electrode 1 1 cm2 and nickel foam 1 1 cm2 were used as the cathode and anode, respectively. The constant current mode was employed for the measurements of the CO2RR. The current density conditions tested were 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, and 500 mAcm2, with a reaction time of 10 min. The electrolyte was 1.0 M KHCO3 and was continuously circulated in the cathode and anode chambers with a flow rate of 5 mLmin1 by using a peristaltic pump. The flow rate of CO2 at the inlet of the gas chamber is 30 sccm, and the outlet is directly connected to the gas chromatograph Shanghai Ruimin, GC2060, which can quantify the concentration of the gas products by means of a standard curve generated from the peak area of the standard mixture of H2, CH4, CO, and C2H4. Characterizations. SEM and TEM were employed to characterize the morphology and microstructure of the electrocatalysts. The crystallographic information and material composition for the samples were collected by XRD D8 Advance Bruker with Cu Kα X-ray radiation λ 1.5418 Å. The quantification of phosphorus in samples was analyzed by ICP-OES on an Agilent 5800 VDV. UPS was recorded on a PHI 5000 Versaprobe III. XPS spectra was carried out on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi photoelectron spectrometer equipped with Al Kα 1486.6 eV X-ray as the excitation source. The",

Abstract: Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction NO3RR is a promising approach to simultaneously realize pollutant removal and ammonia generation. However, this process involves the transfer of eight electrons and nine protons along with multiple by-products, resulting in a significant challenge for achieving high ammonia yield and selectivity. Herein, we introduced bimetallic covalent organic frameworks catalysts with Cu and Co active sites to achieve a two- step tandem reaction, avoiding excessive nitrite accumulation and enabling efficient NO3RR. For the initial two-electron process, the Cu sites in the bimetallic catalyst exhibit a strong binding affinity with nitrate, promoting their conversion to nitrite. The Co sites enhance the supply and adsorption of active hydrogen and stabilize the subsequent six-electron process, thereby improving the overall catalytic efficiency. Compared to monometallic Cu and Co catalysts, the CuCo bimetallic catalyst demonstrates superior ammonia yield and Faradaic efficiency NH3",

Compared to monometallic Cu and Co catalysts, the CuCo bimetallic catalyst demonstrates superior ammonia yield and Faradaic efficiency NH3 yield rate 20.8 mgh1cm2, FE 92.16 in 0.3 M nitrate. Such coordinated two-step process advances the efficiency and applicability of NO3RR through optimizing a cascade catalytic reaction, thereby establishing an innovative path for the engineering of NO3RR electrocatalysts. Introduction Ammonia NH3 remains not only an essential precursor in chemical industries,1 but also a next-generation hydrogen storage medium and carbon-neutral energy carrier.2 However, the conventional Haber-Bosch process for industrial NH3 synthesis involves high-energy consumption and generates significant greenhouse gas emissions.3 As an attractive alternative, electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction NO3RR for NH3 synthesis has emerged due to its environmental friendliness and mild reaction conditions.4 Alternative to nitrogen and nitric oxide,4c, 5 NO3 benefits from its lower dissociation energy, higher solubility, and rapid reduction kinetics at the liquid-solid interface, thus being regarded as a more promising N source for NH3 production.4a, 6 Additionally, NO3 is a prevalent harmful pollutant in contaminated groundwater, industrial wastewater, and nuclear emissions, which poses risks to both the environment and human health. Consequently, converting nitrate into the value-added product NH3 is environmentally beneficial and economically advantageous. The NO3RR process NO3 8e 9H NH3 3H2O, E0 0.69 V vs. RHE involves a complicated eight-electron and nice-proton transfer process,7 and is prone to generate by- product NO2, NO, NH2OH, N2H4, etc..8 This complex process can be divided into two consecutive reactions: a 2e process from NO3 to NO2 and a 6e process from NO2 to NH3.9 Matching the reactivity of two-step reactions is crucial to achieve high ammonia yield and Faradaic efficiency FE. Early studies have shown that Cu could effectively facilitate the adsorption of NO3 due to the similarity of energy levels between the d orbitals of Cu and the LUMO of nitrate.10 Additionally, the low hydrogen accumulation on the Cu11 surface promotes NO3 reduction while suppressing hydrogen evolution reaction HER.12 However, insufficient H supply may kinetically limit the hydrogenation step in the NO3RR.13 This calls for the rational regulation of water adsorption and enhanced supply of H 14 over the surface of Cu-based catalyst.15 The inherent oxyphilic nature and electronegativity of Co could facilitate H adsorption and supply,16 creating an excellent interfacial environment for the NO3 hydrogenation process while mitigating the formation of by- products. Therefore, coupling the Cu and Co active sites has 10.1002anie.202507956 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

Hydrazone- linked COFs represent a promising platform for forming new metal coordination sites containing both N and O atoms after synthesis process, thereby ensuring robust stabilization of metal centers.23 Therefore, it can be envisioned that the chemical designability and tunability of hydrazone-linked COFs can not only provide a promising platform for manipulating the NO3RR process at the electrocatalytic interface, but also contribute to elucidating the cascade electrocatalytic mechanism and reaction pathway, as well as understanding the NO3RR catalytic process to improve ammonia yield and Faradaic efficiency. However, the research in this regard is scarcely reported. Herein, we introduced covalent organic frameworks electrocatalyst with bimetallic active sites to match the two-step cascade reaction, thus avoiding excessive nitrite accumulation and enabling an efficient NO3RR process through Cu-Co tandem mechanism. Focusing on the initial two-electron process, the Cu sites in the bimetallic catalyst exhibit a strong binding affinity with nitrate and promote their efficient conversion to nitrite. The Co sites enhance the supply and adsorption of active hydrogen during the later six-electron process, thereby improving the overall catalytic efficiency. Consequently, the CuCo bimetallic catalyst demonstrates superior ammonia yield and FE NH3 yield rate 20.8 mgh1cm2, FE 92.16 in 0.3 M nitrate, much higher than those of monometallic Cu and Co catalysts. Such a highly matched two-step process provides a feasible strategy for efficiently coupling the cascade process, thereby advances the efficiency and applicability of NO3RR. Results and Discussion A hydrazone-linked COFs catalyst with nitrogen-oxygen heteroatom coordination sites was successfully synthesized via a Schiff base reaction using a solvothermal method. As shown in Figure 1a, 4,4,4- 1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl tribenzaldehyde TTA and terephthalohydrazide TPH were used as monomers. The solvent ratio was optimized mesitylene: 1,4-dioxane 3:7, and the reaction was carried out at 120 C for 72 h to synthesize TTA-TPH. Then TTA-TPH was then dispersed in ethanol containing different concentrations of Cu ions, Co ions, or a mixture of Cu and Co ions. Subsequently, the covalent hydrazone bonds of TTA-TPH could effectively coordinate with metal ions under a nitrogen atmosphere at 60 C, yielding a series of crystalline hydrazone-linked COFs: TTA-TPH-Cu, TTA-TPH-Co, and TTA-TPH-CuCo. The Powder X-ray diffraction PXRD and nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements were performed on TTA- TPH and TTA-TPH-CuCo to analyze their crystallinity and porous characteristics.23b As shown in Figure 1b, four distinct diffraction peaks were clearly observed at 3.58, 6.13, 9.38, and 26.21, corresponding to the 100, 110, 120, and 001 crystal planes, respectively. The PXRD experimental data of TTA-TPH were subjected to Pawley",

The PXRD experimental data of TTA-TPH were subjected to Pawley refinement, which providing good refinement values Rwp3.12 and Rp2.46. Besides, the experimental results showed good agreement with the simulated AA stacking model Figure 1c and Table S1, which possessed the P6 space group with unit cell parameters: ab28.98 Å, c3.37 Å, αβ90, γ120. Then the nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements were conducted to investigate the specific surface area, and the values of TTA-TPH and TTA-TPH-CuCo were calculated to be 844 m2g1 and 699 m2g1, respectively Figure 1d. The inset in Figure 1d shows that the pore size distribution of TTA-TPH and TTA-TPH-CuCo both located around 1.36 nm, which is in line with the simulated AA model. The morphology of TTA-TPH-CuCo was carefully studied using scanning electron microscopy SEM, transmission electron microscopy TEM, high-resolution TEM HR-TEM,23a and atomic force microscopy AFM. It could be clearly observed that the TTA-TPH-CuCo demonstrate a layered stacking morphology with an average thickness of approximately 510 nm Figure S1 and S2. The favorable nanoscale dimensions and large surface area are beneficial for the full exposure of active sites. As shown in Figure 1e-f, HR-TEM of TTA-TPH and TTA-TPH-CuCo both exhibited evident lattice fringes of 001 plane with a distance of 0.33 nm and long-range ordered channels, indicating the intactness of porous and ordered morphology before and after metallization. This aligns well with the PXRD and AA model simulations. Furthermore, the TEM and HR-TEM revealed no metallic clusters Figure S3, indicating the absence of aggregated metal clusters due to the highly ordered structure and uniformly dispersed hydrazine-bond coordination sites. Energy- dispersive X-ray spectroscopy EDS revealed a uniform distribution of C, N, and O throughout the entire TTA-TPH framework. It could be clearly observed that the Cu and Co elements were evenly distributed on the metallized TTA-TPH- CuCo framework Figure S4, providing significant possibility for NO3RR with high activity. We used Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy FT-IR, 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance NMR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS to verify the chemical structure of TTA-TPH and TTA-TPH-CuCo. Firstly, FT-IR spectra of TTA- TPH and TTA-TPH-CuCo both display a strong CN stretching vibration band at 1628 cm1,24 confirming the successful formation of hydrazone bonds Figure S5. Additionally, no significant changes were observed in the FT-IR spectra after metal coordination, indicating successful metalation without altering the framework structure. The characteristic NMR signals for the CN and CO bonds further confirming the formation of hydrazone bonds in our COF Figure S6. Furthermore, the XPS full spectra of TTA-TPH-Cu, TTA-TPH-Co and TTA-TPH-CuCo demonstrated the presence of C, N, O, Cu and Co elements in their frameworks Figure S7.

The Cu 2p spectrum of TTA-TPH- CuCo exhibits two characteristic peaks at binding energies of 935.5 eV and 933.4 eV,10a, 25 which can be assigned to Cu2 and Cu species, respectively Figure 2b. Similarly, the Co 2p spectrum displays distinct peaks at 781.2 eV and 782.8 eV,16a corresponding to Co3 and Co2 oxidation states Figure 2c. Notably, the binding energy positions of Cu 2p and Co 2p orbitals for TTA-TPH-CuCo reveals no observable shifts compared with TTA-TPH-Cu and TTA-TPH-Co Figure S9. This indicates that both Cu and Co maintain their original electronic environments through coordinating with electron-withdrawing groups -CN and -CO in the COFs, effectively suppressing the formation of metallic clusters. X-ray absorption near-edge structure XANES were further employed to clarify the chemical states and local coordination environments of Cu and Co in TTA-TPH-CuCo. As shown in the Cu K-edge XANES spectrum Figure 2d, the absorption edge of TTA-TPH-CuCo is positioned between those of CuO Cu2 and Cu2O Cu reference compounds, unambiguously demonstrating the coexistence of mixed Cu2 Cu oxidation states. Analogously, the Co K-edge XANES spectrum Figure 2g reveals an absorption edge energy situated between those of CoO Co2 and Co2O3 Co3, providing definitive evidence for the simultaneous presence of Co2 and Co3 species. This remarkable agreement between XANES and XPS results confirms the presence of bimetallic centers with multivalent characteristics in the TPH-CuCo system. Moreover, the valence state fitting curves demonstrate that the average oxidation states of Cu and Co atoms in TTA-TPH-CuCo are 1.84 and 2.65, respectively inset of Figure 2d and 2g. The Fourier-transformed extended X-ray absorption fine structure FT-EXAFS analysis revealed prominent coordination peaks at 1.50 Å for Cu and 1.45 Å for Co, corresponding to metal-ligand bonding distances characteristic of Cu-NCu-O and Co-NCo-O coordination environments,",

Overall, the above structural characterizations confirm that TTA- TPH-CuCo are efficiently fabricated with superior crystallinity, high porosity while enriching the Cu and Co active sites. We then conducted NO3RR tests at room temperature in an H-cell containing a neutral electrolyte 0.5 M K2SO4 with different concentrations of KNO3 0.1 M, 0.3 M, and 0.5 M to evaluate the electrocatalytic performance. As shown in Figure 3a and Figure S16, the linear sweep voltammetry LSV experiments were conducted in 0.5 M K2SO4 solution with and without 0.1 M NO3 from 0.05 V to 0.95 V vs. RHE. Firstly, the TTA-TPH-CuCo exhibits a significantly higher current density upon adding NO3 into the system, indicating the high NO3RR activity. Compared to the monometallic TTA-TPH-Cu and TTA-TPH-Co, the bimetallic TTA-TPH-CuCo shows a more positive onset potential, suggesting that the reaction could take place at a relatively positive potential, thereby reducing the energy required to initiate the reaction.

Error bars in 3c-e correspond to the standard deviations of three measurements, the center value of error bars is the average of three measurements TTA-TPH-Co 2.1 mFcm2. The larger ECSA of TTA-TPH-CuCo indicates that more catalytic active sites are exposed to the electrolyte, allowing much effective interaction with NO3 and facilitating rapid mass transfer processes, thereby accelerating the NO3RR reaction rate. We further calculated the turnover frequency TOF of TTA-TPH-Cu, TTA-TPH-Co and TTA-TPH- CuCo catalysts, which were 4152 h1, 5193 h1 and 7882 h1 respectively under identical conditions Figure S18. This indicates that TTA-TPH-CuCo catalyst achieves significantly enhanced reaction throughput per active site per unit time, confirming its superior intrinsic activity per catalytic center. We then detailedly probed the effect of CuCo ratios in TTA- TPH-CuCo on NO3RR performance and determined their actual metal content using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy Figure S19. A series of catalysts with different CuCo ratios were subjected to NO3RR measurements at 0.75 V vs. RHE. We quantitatively determined ammonia concentration using UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, with the corresponding calibration curve presented in Figure S20. As displayed in Figure 3c, TTA-TPH-Cu48Co52 exhibited exceptional performance, achieving an NH3 yield rate of 14.22 mgh1cm2 and an FE of 90.48 Figure S21 in 0.5 M K2SO4 containing 0.1 M NO3 unless otherwise specified,",

Moreover, no hydroxylamine NH2OH was detected during the NO3RR process Figure S23. We also quantitatively analyzed the hydrogen produced during the NO3RR process using gas chromatography Figure S24. The results revealed that TTA-TPH-CuCo exhibited significantly lower FE for hydrogen production FE 3.8 compared to TTA-TPH-Cu FE17.3 and TTA-TPH-Co FE9.4, suggesting enhanced H utilization for the NO hydrogenation on this catalyst. In the NO3RR process, Cu dominates the first-step conversion of NO3 to NO2, generating a large amount of NO2. However, the insufficient H coverage on Cu surface results in kinetic limitations, where the limited H adsorption capacity fails to sustain the subsequent hydrogeneration rate required for NO2 conversion. This kinetic mismatch leads to significant NO2 accumulation, ultimately compromising the NH3-FE. In contrast, Co demonstrates exceptional catalytic performance in the critical second-stage conversion of NO2 to NH3. Comparative analysis reveals that TTA-TPH-Co achieves a 91 reduction in NO2 yield and 27 enhancement in NH3-FE compared to TTA-TPH-Cu, demonstrating Cos superior capability in preventing NO2 accumulation. Therefore, by adjusting the composition and distribution of Cu and Co active sites, TTA-TPH-CuCo achieves synergistic tandem catalysis, where Cu efficiently drives the reduction of NO3 to NO2 while Co ensures rapid NO2 conversion. This precisely engineered coordination between successive reaction steps enables TTA-TPH-CuCo to attain remarkable NH3 yields of 14.22 mgh1cm2 with FE values of 90.5 , representing a significant performance improvement over single-metal based catalysts TTA-TPH-Cu NH3 yield8.08 mgh1cm2, FE 64.5 and TTA-TPH-Co NH3 yield8.70 mgh1cm2, FE 81.2 . The excellent NO3RR performance of TTA-TPH-CuCo surpasses that of most reported catalysts Figure 3h and Table S4. The NO3RR performance is strongly influenced by the local chemical environment. In situ pH monitoring reveals minimal pH variation during NO3 adsorption due to mass transfer limitations, followed by a rapid pH surge triggered by accumulated OH Figure S25.

The competing NO3RR and HER processes exhibit pH-dependent behavior, where the alkaline conditions favor NO3RR kinetics while suppressing HER, thereby enhancing H utilization efficiency and overall NO3RR performance. We further conducted the NO3RR measurement over TTA- TPH-CuCo catalysts at different potential. As shown in Figure 3d and 3e, the NH3 yield and FE over the TTA-TPH-CuCo displays a volcano-shaped curve from 0.55 V to 0.95 V, and achieving highest NH3 yield of 20.8 mgh1cm2 and FE of 92.16 in 0.3 M nitrate at 0.75 V. When increasing the applied cathodic potential from 0.55 V to 0.75 V vs. RHE, the NH3 yield and FE gradually increased due to the gradually accelerated reaction kinetics of the NO3RR and high H utilization rate during hydrogenation steps. However, the further increase of cathodic potential lowered NH3 yield and FE due to the enhanced HER. Our catalyst also demonstrated excellent NH3 yield and FEs in 0.3 M NO3 compared with 0.1 M and 0.5 M. The poor activity under lower NO3 concentration could be attributed to the following two factors: the insufficient nitrate flux on the electrode surface restricts reaction kinetics, while the weakened mass transfer effect exacerbates competition from HER Figure S26. As the NO3 concentration increases, the mass transfer process becomes significantly enhanced, which promotes the adsorption of more H to participate in subsequent hydrogenation reaction. Such competitive adsorption inhibits the HER process, and the NH3 yield rate and FE gradually increase. However, when NO3 concentration reaches 0.5 M, the FE exhibits an unexpected decline. This phenomenon is attributed to insufficient H supply, resulting in substantial accumulation of NO2 intermediates. In addition, the cyclic stability tests were also conducted at 0.75 V vs. RHE over fifty consecutive cycles, with each cycle lasting half an hour. After each cycle, the working electrode was rinsed with deionized water, air-dried naturally, and reused without replacement. Compared to the first cycle, the NH3 yield decreased by only 0.37 mgh1cm2 after fifty cycles Figure 3f, and there was also no detectable Cu or Co signals were observed in post-reaction electrolyte solutions Figure S27, confirming the stable coordination of metallic species within the COF framework. Furthermore, the SEM and TEM after cycle test revealed unchanged morphology and preserved 001 lattice fringes with 0.33 nm Figure S28 and S29, while XRD patterns retained maintained characteristic diffraction peaks at 3.58 Figure S30. These results demonstrate the excellent structural robustness of TTA-TPH-CuCo, where the anchored metal centers resist agglomeration, leaching, and framework collapse during electrochemical measurements. The superior performance could be elaborated by the following reasons. Firstly, the COFs are functioned as promising support to anchoring Cu and Co single atoms with coordinatively unsaturated sites, efficiently avoiding the process of pyrolysis and the aggregation of Cu and Co atoms with inherent high surface free energy. The ordered and stable structure of COFs and the dispersed",

Firstly, the COFs are functioned as promising support to anchoring Cu and Co single atoms with coordinatively unsaturated sites, efficiently avoiding the process of pyrolysis and the aggregation of Cu and Co atoms with inherent high surface free energy. The ordered and stable structure of COFs and the dispersed active sites can inhibit the aggregation of metal atoms, thus enhancing the stability of the catalyst. Secondly, COFs are a type of crystalline porous organic polymer where predesigned organic linkers are precisely integrated into two-dimensional extended structures with periodic frameworks and well-defined pores utilizing dynamic covalent chemistry. By virtue of regular porous structures, precisely tunable pore sizes, long-range ordered crystalline topological networks, and atomically dispersed metal sites, COFs could provide a unique research perspective for facilitating rapid electron transport, optimizing the mass transfer kinetics of NO3, revealing complex reaction mechanism. Based on the excellent NO3RR performance of TTA-TPH- CuCo, a Zn-NO3 battery was assembled with TTA-TPH-CuCo as the cathode and zinc foil as the anode to simultaneously eliminate nitrate, produce ammonia and generate power Figure S31. Interestingly, the battery could achieve a NH3 yield of 52.4 μmolcm2h1 and power density of 1.2 mWcm2, advancing their significant potential for practical applications. To identify the N source in NH₃ products and exclude potential contamination, the Isotopic labeling experiments were performed using 15NO3 and 14NO3 as nitrogen sources to trace the origin of nitrogen in the produced NH3 Figure 3g.

In addition, to obtain information on intermediates and identify the reaction pathway of NO3RR over prepared catalysts, in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry DEMS was used to capture volatile gaseous molecules generated during the reaction. In the in situ DEMS measurements of TTA-TPH- CuCo Figure 4a, the apparent signal of mz 17 and weak peaks of mz 2 were captured, which could be assigned to the main product NH3 and by-product H2. Meanwhile, the NO3RR process over TTA-TPH-Cu exhibited notable HER activity, with substantial H2 evolution being detected in the DEMS measurement Figure S34 and S35. In contrast, the TTA-TPH-Co catalyst demonstrated effective suppression of HER. Notably, the incorporation of Co sites in the bimetallic TTA-TPH-CuCo significantly enhanced the utilization efficiency of H for the NO hydrogenation, thereby effectively suppressing competitive HER. The DEMS also revealed characteristic signals of critical intermediates NOH and NH₂, with TTA-TPH-CuCo displaying enhanced signal intensities for both species Figure S36. These findings conclusively verifying the tandem catalytic mechanism of TTA-TPH-CuCo in NO3RR.

Additionally, critical reaction intermediates with a characteristic mz value of 31 was also detected through in situ DEMS, corresponding to either NOH or NHO, which has great effect on the subsequent reaction. In order to further confirm the reaction pathway, in situ attenuated total reflection-surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy ATR-IRAS was used to confirm solution-phase intermediates and adsorbed species on the electrode surface. The in situ ATR-IRAS measurements were conducted in a 0.5 M K2SO4 solution containing 0.1 M KNO3.

In the broad overlapping absorption band in the range of 3000 to 3700 cm-1,32 the peaks at 3600, 3360 and 3190 cm-1 are attributed to vN-H, vO-H of adsorbed H2O, and NOH respectively. With increasing applied potential or prolonged reaction time, the intensities of these key intermediates increased, clearly indicating the active progression of the NO3RR process from NO3 to NH3. In combination the in situ DEMS with ATR- IRAS results, we could conclude that the conversion of NO3 to NH3 proceeds via the following possible pathways:NO3 NO2 NO NOH N NH NH2 NH3. In a neutral system, the hydrogen ions H requisite for the hydrogenation process during the NO3RR predominantly stem from the interfacial water adsorbed on the catalyst surface. As shown in Figure 4c and 4d, the in situ ATR-IRAS analysis of TTA- TPH-CuCo in the 3000 to 3700 cm-1 region revealed a characteristic vibrational signal assignable to interfacial water,33 which was resolved through Gaussian deconvolution into three states: tetra-coordinated hydrogen-bonded water 4-HB-H2O, bi- coordinated hydrogen-bonded water 2-HB-H2O, and alkali metal-ion-coordinated water K-H2O.30, 34 This multimodal water coordination architecture suggests the formation of dynamic hydration layers at the electrocatalyst-electrolyte interface, where the K-H2O is closely associated with water dissociation.35 Notably, the area fraction of K-H2O consistently maintained the highest proportion among interfacial hydration components, exhibiting a remarkable enhancement from 0.9 to 21.9 when decreasing the applied potential. This result suggests that TTA- TPH-CuCo facilitates the dissociation of H2O, generating a sufficient H supply on the catalyst surface, thereby promoting the efficient progression of NO3RR. The sufficient supply of H is the key to ensure the steady and efficient progress of the NO3RR. We then further monitor the H signal during NO3RR process via electron paramagnetic resonance EPR spectroscopy by using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline- N-oxide DMPO as H trapping agent. In a 0.5 M K2SO4 solution, nine characteristic peaks corresponding to H with an intensity ratio approaching 1:1:2:1:2:1:2:1:1 were achieved. As evidenced by Figure S38, introduction of NO3 triggers significant attenuation of H signals in the TTA-TPH-CuCo system, demonstrating active participation of these H during the hydrogenation of NO3RR intermediates. This substantial H consumption correlates with enhanced catalytic activity and accelerated reaction dynamics observed in the bimetallic CuCo catalyst system. In contrast, both the supply and consumption levels of H in the TTA-TPH-Cu were inferior to those in the Co-containing system, which hinder the hydrogenation of the intermediates, resulting in lower activity with a FE of 64.5 in 0.1 M NO3 and 0.5 M K2SO4. Furthermore, the sustained and stable supply of H is critical for enhancing activity and efficiency. To monitor the temporal evolution of H content, EPR spectra were recorded at 5 and 10 min, represented by gray and colored lines, respectively Figure 4f. The content of H in the TTA-TPH-CuCo system remained nearly constant after 10 minutes, indicating its ability to",

To monitor the temporal evolution of H content, EPR spectra were recorded at 5 and 10 min, represented by gray and colored lines, respectively Figure 4f. The content of H in the TTA-TPH-CuCo system remained nearly constant after 10 minutes, indicating its ability to stably and continuously supply H, which supports the robust and efficient NO3RR performance of TTA-TPH-CuCo. In addition, the theoretical calculation of the H2O dissociation pathway further confirm that Co and its adjacent N and O atoms play important roles in the generation and utilization of H. As shown in Figure 4g, the H2O adsorption and dissociation on the N and O atoms adjacent to the Co site are much more favorable than those on the Cu site Figure S39, and the H2O adsorption and dissociation on the O atom are much more energetically favorable than N atom. As shown in Figure 4h, H2O is adsorbed on the O atom beside Co and dissociates into H-OH. The generated H is also more stably adsorbed on the O atom, forming an environment rich in H. This result demonstrated that the -N- Co-O- catalytic interface could enable efficient H supply for the NO3RR reaction, then the generated H can be immediately utilized in the hydrogenation process and maintain a dynamic equilibrium of H concentration. We further investigated the interaction between NO3 and TTA-TPH-CuCo catalyst through theoretical calculations. Firstly, we utilized the projected density of states PDOS to confirm the local electronic states near the Fermi level EF of TTA-TPH- CuCo before and after the adsorption of NO3. The orbital overlap of Cu-3d, N-2p, and O-2p near the EF indicates the formation of new hybrid orbitals through strong electronic interactions, which ensures the effective charge transfer of the catalyst Figure 5a. After NO3 adsorption, the N NO3-2p orbitals of NO3 overlap with the above orbitals, revealing significant electronic coupling between NO3 and Cu active centers in the TTA-TPH-CuCo catalyst Figure 5b. The upshifted Cu-3d orbitals after NO3 adsorption further indicated the strong interaction between NO3 and Cu catalytic sites, which holds substantial significance for the subsequent NO3RR reaction. To elucidate the interfacial charge transfer, the differential charge density of TTA-TPH-CuCo before and after NO3 adsorption was calculated in Figure 5c, where cyan represents the loss of charge and yellow represents the gain of charge. It could be seen that there was an obvious electron transfer between the metallic Cu site and NO3. The bader calculation shown that the electron of Cu is decreased from 10.41 to 10.22, featuring an electron accumulation on NO3 Δq0.19 e. Furthermore, theoretical calculations in Figure 5d revealed that the NONOH step had a lower endothermic energy barrier 0.63 eV compared to the NO NHO step 0.8 eV, indicating that the former is a more favorable pathway and agreeing well 10.1002anie.202507956 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

For the rate-determining NO3 NO3H hydrogenation step, the Cu site exhibits a lower activation barrier ΔG 0.49 eV compared to the Co site ΔG 0.57 eV. This thermodynamic preference, combined with enhanced NO3 adsorption due to favorable orbital hybridization, confirming that Cu center is the primary center for initiating the 2- electron reduction pathway. As shown in Figure 5e, the theoretical calculations further revealed distinct catalytic function of Cu and Co sites in governing the NO3RR pathway energetics. Critical to subsequent steps, the adsorption of NO2 intermediate shows evident site dependence, with Co exhibiting stronger adsorption energy 4.89 eV than Cu 4.00 eV. The free energy change of the process from Cu site to Co site is 0.89 eV, which is a spontaneous process and thermodynamically favorable. For the NO2 NO2H hydrogenation step, the Co site exhibits a beneficial energy barrier ΔG 1.38 eV compared to the Cu site ΔG 1.23 eV.

    "text": "forming NO2 intermediates. These intermediates preferentially adsorb on Co sites, enabling Co as electron donors to drive NO2 reduction. In this process, the tandem Cu and Co active sites, as the key mediators of electron transfer, ultimately enabling efficient conversion from NO3 to NH3. These simulation results are in excellent agreement with our experimental conclusions from in situ DEMS and in situ ATR-IRAS, clearly clarifying the tandem catalytic mechanism of TTA-TPH-CuCo in NO3RR Figure 5f. Firstly, the mismatch rates between the rapid conversion process of NO3 on TTA-TPH-Cu and the subsequent sluggish hydrogenation process leads to the accumulation of NO2. The shortage of NO2 on TTA-TPH-Co also prevents the realization of high-efficient NH3 production performance. For TTA- TPH-CuCo, the Cu site significantly adsorbs NO3, serving as the adsorption and activation center in the NO3RR process. Subsequently, the -N-Co-O- interface simultaneously promotes the dissociation of H₂O and the supply of H to ensure the steady progress of the subsequent hydrogenation process. The tandem catalysis of Cu and Co optimizes the intermediate steps and transition states of the reaction, thereby accelerating the kinetics of the proton-coupled electron transfer reaction. Conclusion In summary, we have designed and fabricated a bimetallic TTA- TPH-CuCo catalysts with tandem active sites for the cascade conversion of nitrate to ammonia. Compared with the monometallic counterparts, TTA-TPH-CuCo achieves a high NH3 yield rate of 20.8 mgh1cm2 with FE of 92.16 in 0.3 M nitrate, outperforming most of the reported NO3RR electrocatalysts in the literature. Through in situ DEMS, in situ ATR-IRAS, and theoretical calculations, we have elucidated the cascade mechanism occurring over the TTA-TPH-CuCo. The Cu sites function as the activation centers for adsorption and the initial 2e process. The N-Co-O- interface promotes water adsorption and dissociation, facilitates the formation of H-rich interface and boosts the subsequent 6e process, thus accelerating efficient synthesis of ammonia. This work not only emphasizes the achievement of efficient NO3RR through matching a two-step tandem reaction, but also paves the way for designing highly efficient electrocatalysts for NO3RR and possible other reactions in which high selectivity is desired.

The Cu sites serve as the activation centers for adsorption and the initial 2e process. The N-Co-O- interface promotes water adsorption and dissociation, facilitates the formation of H-rich interface and boosts the subsequent 6e process, thus accelerating efficient synthesis of ammonia. 10.1002anie.202507956 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.
