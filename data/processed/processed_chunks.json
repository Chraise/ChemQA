However, the CO2 reduction reaction CO2RR mechanism during discharge in nonaqueous electrolytes, strongly influenced by the solvent environment and surface structure, remains unclear. Here, we systematically investigate the CO2RR on atomically flat Auhkl single crystal surfaces, providing direct spectral evidence of vital surfaceintermediate species using in situ Raman spectroscopy. Our findings, combined with theoretical calculations, reveal that high- donor-number DN electrolytes facilitate a solution-mediated pathway, where Li forms stable solvation structures with solvent molecules that react with CO2 to produce CO and Li2CO3. Conversely, low-DN electrolytes promote a surface-mediated pathway due to limited solvation, enhancing direct LiCO2 interactions on the electrode surface. Among the various Auhkl surfaces, Au110 shows superior catalytic activity, greatly enhancing CO2 activation. This research offers crucial insights into the interplay between solvent chemistry and surface structure in the CO2RR, guiding future LiCO2 batteries optimization. INTRODUCTION Rising atmospheric CO2 levels from fossil fuel overuse accelerate extreme weather events, prompting researchers to develop efficient CO2 capture and utilization technologies essential for sustainable development.14 Among these technologies, rechargeable LiCO2 batteries have gained significant attention for their dual functionality in CO2 conversion and energy storage, offering a high discharge voltage and an impressive theoretical energy density.58 However, their development is hindered by persistent challenges, including large polarization, low Coulombic efficiency, and cathode degradation,9 which are closely linked to the sluggish kinetics of the CO2 redox reaction at the cathode.1012 During the discharge of a LiCO2 batteries, the cathode CO2 reduction reaction CO2RR is widely accepted via a four-electron reaction pathway, described by the equation: 4Li 3CO2 4e2Li2CO3 C.1316 Although specific disproportionation processes involving various intermediates can occur, the main discharge products are predominantly Li2CO3 and carbon. Recent studies, however, suggest that CO2RR can also proceed via a two-electron reaction pathway,17 yielding products such as Li2C2O4 or Li2CO3 along with CO, depending on the reaction conditions.15,18 Despite variations in final products and pathways, the initial step of CO2RR in LiCO2 chemistry typically involves the formation of a CO2 intermediate.18 This CO2 species, which may either adsorb onto the catalyst surface or dissolve in the electrolyte, serves as the active intermediate and represents the rate-determining step of the process. However, the subsequent transformation into final discharge products depends significantly on the specific properties of the electrolytes and catalysts. The solvation chemistry of the electrolyte plays a crucial role in governing reaction dynamics and product formation in Li O2 and LiS batteries.1922 For example, the solvent type and structure can influence the extent of solvation of metal ions, such as Li or Na, which in turn",

The solvation chemistry of the electrolyte plays a crucial role in governing reaction dynamics and product formation in Li O2 and LiS batteries.1922 For example, the solvent type and structure can influence the extent of solvation of metal ions, such as Li or Na, which in turn affects ion migration rates and overall reaction activity.

These insights provide critical guidance for the rational design of high- performance catalystssystems.3034 However, despite exten- sive in situ studies investigating the dynamic interplay between intermediate species, interfacial structure, and product selectivity in LiCO2 batteries during discharge, the under- lying reaction mechanisms remain debated. Notably, research on how solvation effects influence interfacial reaction intermediate species and reaction pathways in this context is still limited. Therefore, employing advanced characterization techniques, particularly highly sensitive fingerprint spectrosco- py, is essential for elucidating the complex relationships among the catalyst structure, reaction intermediates, and electrolytes. In situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy SERS, a powerful surface analysis fingerprint technique, has been widely used to monitor important electrocatalytic pro- cesses.3537 Furthermore, shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy SHINERS,33 developed based on SERS technology, offers exceptional sensitivity and better universal- ity, allowing researchers to directly obtain enhanced Raman signals from atomically flat model single crystal surfaces with well-defined surface atomicelectronic structures.39,40 These surfaces are among the most important model systems in fundamental research, providing insights that traditional SERS techniques cannot achieve.41 In this work, we explore the reaction pathways of the CO2RR in LiCO2 batteries using electrolytes with varying DN values on Auhkl single crystal electrodes. By employing in situ SHINERS, along with electrochemical techniques and theoretical calculations, we obtain direct spectral evidence of vital surfaceintermediate species, including CO2 , CO, and Li2CO3. We also reveal how different surface structures regulate the adsorption of these active intermediates, as well as how the solvation effects of varying DN electrolytes influence the CO2RR pathway, subsequently affecting the reactivity of CO2RR.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION To examine the critical role of electrolyte solvation on the CO2RR, we performed a series of electrochemical measure- ments on an Au111 electrode, using electrolytes with varying DN values. For this study, we utilized LiClO4 dissolved in Figure 1.

We begin with an inspection of the cyclic voltammetry CV responses of the two systems, as illustrated in Figure 1a. For the DMSO-based electrolyte, the reduction current in the first CV cycles shows minimal variation compared to the second and third cycles after three CV scans. In contrast, the PC-based electrolyte exhibits a pronounced decrease in reduction current after the first cycle. This reduction in current is likely associated with the formation of more insulating CO2 reduction products on the electrode surface in the PC system.42 These observations underscore the significant influence of the solvents DN on the CO2RR. To delve deeper into the impacts of DN on solvation behavior, we employed the Irish method,43 coupled with Gaussian peak fitting, to derive Liion solvation rate curves from Raman spectral data Figure S1. As depicted in Figure 1b, the Liion solvation rate in the DMSO system exceeds 80 across the concentration range studied. Conversely, the solvation rate in PC system is considerably lower, particularly at low concentrations, where it drops below 60. These findings suggest that the distinct solvation environments in DMSO and PC play a critical role in shaping their electrochemical behaviors and reduction mechanisms. To further assess the impact of solvation chemistry on the chemical pathway of CO2RR in different electrolyte, the RRDE technique was employed to qualitatively understand the reaction processes Figure 1c,d. In the DMSO-based electrolyte, a distinct reduction current is observed at the ring beyond the disk, indicating that surfaceintermediate species produced, such as CO2 and CO, at the disk undergo further reduction at the ring.

In the DMSO-based electrolyte, a distinct reduction current is observed at the ring beyond the disk, indicating that surfaceintermediate species produced, such as CO2 and CO, at the disk undergo further reduction at the ring. In contrast, for the PC- based electrolyte, only a disk current is detected, with no visible current at the ring. This suggests that in DMSO, the reduction of surfaceintermediate species produced occurs in solution, whereas in PC, the reduction takes place predom- inantly on the catalyst surface. To systematically investigate the surface composition evolution of Auhkl single crystal electrodes under different electrolyte conditions, we performed complementary SEMEDS and XPS analyses. In the DMSO- based electrolyte system, postcycling characterization revealed only localized Li2CO3 deposits on the Auhkl electrode surfaces Figures S2S4. Strikingly, when using PC-based electrolyte under identical CO2RR conditions, we observed markedly different deposition behaviorthe Auhkl surfaces became predominantly covered by a continuous Li2CO3 layer. This leads to the conclusion that in low-DN solvents like PC, surfaceintermediate species formed on the electrode surface are further reduced there, leading to the formation of a dense Li2CO3 layer that covers the active sites on the electrode surface. This surface-dominated reduction pathway adversely impacts cycling performance. Conversely, in high-DN solvents like DMSO, CO2 is reduced to surfaceintermediate species produced on the electrode surface, which subsequently interact with solvated Li ions, following a solution-mediated reduction pathway. Our corresponding Raman spectroscopic experiments also detected adsorbed CO product signals on the electrode surface in PC-based electrolytes, but not in DMSO-based Figure 2.

However, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry Figure S6 was used to further elucidate the evolution of CO in DMSO-based electrolytes. The results indicate that the generated CO desorbs into the solution, providing additional evidence for distinct reduction mecha- nisms in these systems. Actually, the pathway of cathode product formation in the CO2RR is closely linked to the structure of the solvated Li complex, Li-solventn. The coordination strength between Li and solvent molecules significantly influences the Lewis hardness of Li and, consequently, its ability to interact with intermediate products. Our calculations of the change in hardness for solvated Li and CO2 in different electrolyte systems44 Figure S7 reveal that in solvents with higher DN values, Li preferentially forms the solvated complex Li- solventn. This solvated complex exhibits substantially lower hardness compared with free Li, making it more reactive with CO2 .

As a result, the site of final product formation in the CO2RR shifts, favoring a solution-based reaction pathway in high-DN electrolytes. This highlights the critical role of solvation chemistry in determining the reaction mechanism and product distribution in the CO2RR. To further investigate these relevant reaction processes, we will employ highly sensitive in situ Raman spectroscopy. First, we employed electrochemical CV scanning to characterize three low-index Auhkl single crystals, which show a relatively good crystal facet quality Figure S8. Then the CV curves for the Auhkl surfaces in a 0.5 M electrolyte are shown in Figures 2a and S9S10. Under CO2-saturated conditions, the onset of CO2 reduced current during the negative sweep occurs at approximately 0.6 V on the Au110 surface, followed by Au100, which exhibits the highest onset potential, and Au111, which has the lowest onset potential. This indicates that the catalytic activity for the CO2RR on three facets follows the order: Au110 Au100 Au111. Meanwhile, the reduction peak potentials for the three facets are as follows: Au110 ca. 1.448 V A u100 Au111 1.483 V. These findings align with previous studies,45 which have often attributed the superior catalytic activity of Au110 surface to its relatively open surface structure. However, a deeper understanding of this phenom- enon remains lacking. Furthermore, we extended our investigation to 10-cycle CV tests of CO2RR in DMSO solution on the Auhkl single crystal surfaces Figure S11. The long-cycle measurements revealed that the electro- chemical behavior stabilized after the second cycle, with the reduction peak area showing only a minimal decrease upon continuous cycling in the DMSO-based electrolyte. This observation demonstrates excellent electrochemical reversibil- Figure 3.

During the negative potential sweep from 0.0 to 0.4 V, no obvious new Raman peaks are observed, apart from those associated with the LiClO4-DMSO electrolyte itself. However, at a potential of 0.6 V, several prominent Raman peaks emerge at 458, 485, and 1102 cm1. These peaks are closely linked to the onset of the CO2RR, and their intensities evolve with further decreases in potential. The peak at 458 cm1 reaches maximum intensity at 0.7 V before gradually diminishing as the potential becomes more negative. While the peak at 485 cm1 is most intense at 1.1 V. When the potential is reduced to 1.4 V, the intensities of the peaks at 458, 485, and 1102 cm1 decline sharply, while a new peak at 1086 cm1 appears and increases in intensity Figure S12. To confirm that the observed Raman features are not influenced by DMSO breakdown, additional in situ Raman measurements are conducted under an Ar atmosphere Figure S13. No new Raman peaks indicative of DMSO breakdown are detected across the potential range of 0.0 to 1.5 V, verifying the stability of the DMSO-based electrolyte under these experimental conditions. To confirm the attribution of the observed Raman peaks, we conducted comparative experiments using the 13CO2 isotope Figure 2c. For clarity, we applied peak fitting to the region between 420 and 520 cm1. The peak initially observed at 458 cm1 shifts to 455 cm1 in the presence of the 13CO2 isotope, confirming its association with C-containing species. These findings align well with calculations based on the simple harmonic vibration peak offset equation, and we assign the peak of 458 cm1 to νAuC vibrations. In contrast, the peak at 485 cm1 shows minimal sensitivity to the 13CO2 isotope, exhibiting no significant shift. This peak can be attributed to νAuO, according to previous reports.46 Additionally, the peak at around 1102 cm1 exhibits a shift in the 13CO2 isotope experiment, aligning with the stretching vibration of the CO bond in the CO2 species. The peak at 1086 cm1 remains stable during a negative potential scan to 1.3 V, without notable shift in the 13CO2 experiment, suggesting its attribution to Li2CO3.5 We systematically explored the adsorption configurations of CO2 by using ab initio molecular dynamics AIMD simulations. This approach further corroborated that the Raman peaks at 458, 485, and 1102 cm1 correspond to different vibrational modes of the CO2 intermediate on the Au111 surface Figures 2d and S14. A more detailed discussion of the adsorption configurations of CO2 species on various single crystal surfaces is provided in a subsequent section. To investigate the influence of solvation effects on the CO2RR, the DMSO system, known for its good charge and discharge reversibility, was selected for this study. The Raman peak corresponding to the SO bond of the DMSO molecule was analyzed to examine changes in the solvation structure and its linkage to the reaction mechanism.

The Raman peak corresponding to the SO bond of the DMSO molecule was analyzed to examine changes in the solvation structure and its linkage to the reaction mechanism. Specifically, the Raman spectrum in the SO region 9851140 cm1 was fitted using Lorentzian functions.4750 As shown in Figure 3a, three distinct peaks were identified: 1028 cm1, corresponding to polymeric DMSO,51 1044 cm1 associated with linear dimer DMSO, and 1058 cm1 attributed to ring-shaped dimer DMSO.49 The increase in salt concentration leads to an enhancement in the peak intensities at 1058 cm1 and 1044 cm1 Figure S1, indicating that the dimeric DMSO structure facilitates the formation of solvation complexes between Li ions and DMSO molecules. Figure 3b presents the fitting results and peak ratio analysis at different potentials. The peak at 1028 cm1 decreases proportionally within the potential range of 0.3 to 0.6 V, while the peak at 1058 cm1 increases, suggesting that the initial electron reduction process primarily involves the solvation reaction of ring-shaped dimer DMSO with Li ions. Conversely, the peak at 1044 cm1 shows a proportional increase in the potential range from 1.0 to 1.3 V, indicating the solvation structure formed by linear dimer DMSO. To further investigate the reaction products, gas chromatog- raphy measurement was conducted to identify the gaseous outputs of the reaction. Regular octahedral Au nanoparticles Figure S15,52 primarily composed of Au111, were employed to better minimize the catalytic effects from other non-Au111 crystal facets.53 The result indicates that CO production starts at a potential of 1.4 V Figure S16. Based on these observations, we propose that under the influence of the solvent, CO2 is adsorbed onto Au111 to form CO2 . As the potential decreases, CO2 is further reduced to CO and Li2CO3, facilitated by the interaction of Li ions and dissolved CO2 in the electrolyte. For further verification, we conducted in situ Raman measurement in the 0.5 M CO2-saturated TBAClO4-DMSO electrolyte. Within the potential range of 0.0 to 1.6 V, the peaks located at 458, 485, and 1102 cm1 are all observed Figure 3c. Notably, when Li was replaced with TBA in this electrolyte, the peak at 1102 cm1 remained visible while the peak at 1086 cm1 was absent. This suggests that Li plays a critical role in facilitating the conversion of the 1102 cm1 peak to the 1086 cm1 peak, corresponding to the transformation of CO2 to CO3 2. Moreover, we employed AIMD simulations to investigate the impact of DMSO on the CO2 adsorption process at the Au111 surface and at the electrochemical interface. Through these computations, ensembles of DMSO configurations for the interface region, including intermediates, were obtained. This approach ensures that the stabilization or destabilization of the interactions between the electrolyte and the intermediate is independent of the specific DMSO structure utilized see the computational details of the Methods section for AIMD.

This suggests the formation of a diatomic adsorption structure of OCO on Au111 Figure S17.

Here, we compare the influence of low-index Auhkl facets on the reaction by in situ Raman spectral experiments. As shown in Figure 4a, during the negative potential sweep, three emerging Journal of the American Chemical Society pubs.acs.orgJACS Article https:doi.org10.1021jacs.5c04157 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2025, 147, 1985919867 19863 peaks at 458, 485, and 1110 cm1 are observed on the Au110 surface, consistent with those observed on Au111. These peaks indicate the formation and evolution of key CO2 intermediates during the CO2RR process. However, distinct trends and shifts in these peaks were noted for different crystal planes, shedding light on the role of the surface structure in the reaction dynamics Figures S18 and S19. On both Au110 and Au100 Figure 4b, the peak located at around 1100 cm1, attributed to CO2 species, shifts to 1112 cm1 for Au110. This blue shift is likely due to the stronger CO bonding energy of CO2 on this facet. The Stark slopes of the 1100 cm1 peak for CO2 species on Au111, Au110, and Au100 are 9.3 cm1V, 14.6 cm1 V, and 14.0 cm1V, respectively Figure 4c. These results suggest that CO2 species on Au110 are more sensitive to interfacial electric fields compared with the other facets. To further validate the role of CO2 in the catalytic performance, we conducted experiments in PC-based electrolytes on Au110 surfaces. CV measurements revealed lower LiCO2 reduction activity in PC compared to DMSO Figure S20. In situ Raman spectroscopy results further showed that only Li2CO3 1086 cm1 signals were detected in the PC system. The absence of CO2 in the PC electrolyte correlates with its lower activity, suggesting that CO2 stabilization is critical for efficient reduction of CO2 reduction. AIMD simulations further demonstrate that the proposed CO2 intermediate is stably adsorbed on Au111, Au110, and Au100 surfaces, exhibiting OCO bond angles of 129.7, 132.1, and 127.9, respectively Figure 4d. The CO bond lengths at the solution-facing end for CO2 adsorbed on Au111, Au110, and Au100 surfaces are 1.235 Å, 1.255 Å, and 1.236 Å, respectively Figure S21, while those at the adsorption-facing end are 1.275 Å, 1.246 Å, and 1.279 Å, respectively Figure S22.

The larger OCO angle on Au110 indicates that the non-adsorbed oxygen atom is closer to the surface, facilitating electron transfer and enhancing catalytic activity. Meanwhile, CO2 adsorbed on Au110 exhibits an increased susceptibility to bond dissociation, attributed to its longer solution-facing CO bond. This configuration likely lowers the energy barrier for the first electron transfer in the CO2RR, promoting the reaction and boosting the activity of Au110. Among the three Auhkl surfaces, Au110 demonstrates the best CO2RR performance due to its higher density of step sites. These steps optimize the configuration of CO2 and increase its susceptibility to an electric field. Combined with calculations, it is evident that the CO bond length at the step site of Au110 is significantly shorter than that at the other two crystal surfaces, resulting in a blue-shifted Raman peak Figure 4c. This shift further supports the conclusion that the Au110 surface possesses a higher bond energy. Additionally, CO2 adsorbed on Au110 exhibits the longest CO bond at the solution-facing end and the lowest bond energy, suggesting that the O atoms at the solution-facing end are more readily dissociated compared to those on the other crystal planes. Consequently, the stepped structure on Au110 enhances CO2 activation and improves catalytic activity, highlighting the importance of step sites in optimizing the CO2RR performance. Based on the results of in situ Raman experiments and theoretical calculations, combined with previous studies, the CO2RR mechanism on the Auhkl surface in different electrolytes is proposed as follows Figure 5: CO2 initially Figure 4.

Through electron transfer, CO2 is formed as an intermediate. In high- DN electrolytes, reduction proceeds predominantly through a solution-mediated pathway, yielding CO and Li2CO3, whereas in low-DN electrolytes, the reaction follows a surface-mediated pathway to produce the same products. Both the CV cycling results from single crystal surfaces and the practical cycling performance of nanoparticles in LiCO2 batteries Figures S23 and S24 consistently demonstrate that the solution- mediated pathway facilitates the LiCO2 reaction. In addition, the solvation of Li and CO2 plays a crucial role in determining the reaction pathway. In high-DN electrolytes, Li readily forms stable solvation structures with solvent molecules, reducing its hardness.

In high-DN electrolytes, Li readily forms stable solvation structures with solvent molecules, reducing its hardness. According to HSAB theory,54 the softened solvated Li preferentially interacts with CO2 , facilitating solution-mediated reduction. Conversely, in low- DN electrolytes, the limited solvation capacity promotes direct interaction between Li and CO2 on the electrode surface, favoring a surface-mediated reduction process. Furthermore, discrepancies exhibit between the Au110, Au111, and Au100 planes because of the differences in the Gibbs free energies and dissociation barriers of the same intermediate on these crystal planes. These variations result in distinct catalytic activity and selectivity across different facets. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, we employed in situ Raman, combined with electrochemical techniques and AIMD calculations, to system- atically investigate the CO2RR process at the Auhkl single- crystal surface. Our study highlights the critical role of solvent chemistry in dictating the CO2RR mechanism, influenced by the DN of the solvent and structure of Li-solventn. In high- DN electrolytes, Li readily forms stable solvation structures with solvent molecules and preferentially interacts with CO2 , resulting in a solution-mediated pathway that produces CO and Li2CO3. Conversely, in low-DN electrolytes, the limited solvation capacity promotes direct interaction between Li and CO2 on the electrode surface, favoring a surface-mediated reduction process. Additionally, the CO2RR on various Auhkl planes exhibits different activity. Among them, Au110 demonstrates superior performance by enhancing CO2 activation and improving the catalytic activity. These findings provide significant insights into the interplay between solvent chemistry and surface structure in the CO2RR mechanism and could aid in the design and optimization of future LiCO2 batteries.

The unraveling of the underlying mechanisms relies on regulating molecular adsorption. However, achieving such regulation at the single- molecule level remains a challenge. Herein, we utilized a combined ionic liquid and scanning tunneling microscope break junction methods to tune single 4-pyridin-4- ylaniline molecules gradually from the ﬂat conﬁguration to the upright one and found that only the upright conﬁguration can trigger the oxidative coupling. Exper- imental and theoretical ﬁndings demonstrated that the ionic liquid reduced the electron density of the Au electrode, giving rise to the evolution of the interaction between molecule and electrode from the Au-π domi- nated coupling to the Au-σ dominated one. This work will inspire the exploration of strategies that can control the molecular assembly, accelerate the chemical reaction, and promote the fabrication of organic devices. Introduction Molecular adsorption at the solidliquid interfaces plays a vital role in catalytic reactions,1 energy utilization,2 charge transfer,3 mass transfer,4 and other crucial processes in chemistry and molecular electronics.58 Compared to homo- geneous organic synthesis reactions in solvents, the chemical reaction of molecular adsorption on the metal surface is more complicated. The electronic device fabrication and chemical processes on electrode surfaces have diverse mechanisms. The conﬁguration of surface molecules may determine the reac- tion activation energy,9 change the reaction selectivity,10 and reaction pathway11 during the surface chemical reaction process. It is widely recognized that controlling the adsorption J. Xun, J.-X. Chen, T.-R. Diao, L.-K. Chen, Y.-L. Zou, C.-C. Luo, J. Shi, D.-Y. Wu, Y.

However, conducting research remains a challenge due to the lack of experimental strategies and instrument methods at the scale. The scanning tunneling microscope break junction STM- BJ technique can fabricate and characterize single-molecule junctions in ambient conditions.1214 The electron transport through the constructed single-molecule junctions is ultra- sensitive to the microscopic conﬁgurations of the molecules adsorbed at the solidliquid interfaces, such as moleculemetal interactions,1518 adsorption sites,1921 and geometries.2224 Inversely, the characterization of the electron transport, termed single-molecule conductance measurement, can be utilized to study interfacial molecular behavior at the single-molecule level.

Speciﬁcally, regulating the solvent environment impacts the adsorption behavior,25 energy conversion,26 chemical synthesis,27 and other aspects of molecular interfaces.28 Azo aromatic compounds have drawn much attention in many ﬁelds like molecular photoswitches,29 dyes,30 photochromic molecules,31 infor- mation processing and digital storage devices.32 Compared to conventional strategies for preparing azo molecules,33 the electrochemically driven oxidative coupling of anilines man- ifests many advantages, such as diversity, ease of operation, and environmentally friendly.34,35 However, the chemical reaction mechanism on the electrode surface is complex and depends on reaction conditions such as solvent,36 solution pH,37 and applied potentials.38 In this work, we utilized the combined electrochemistry and STM-BJ techniques to study the adsorption conﬁguration of 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecules at the single-molecule level. We continuously regulated the adsorption conﬁguration by increasing volume ratio of 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexaﬂuorophosphate HMIMPF6 ionic liquid in a propylene carbonate PC solution. To demonstrate the conﬁgura- tional evolution in molecular adsorption, we measured contact angle, Raman spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible UV vis absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spec- troscopy XPS. As proof of principle, we showed that such a strategy of regulating adsorption conﬁguration could accelerate the electrochemically driven oxidative coupling of 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline, and produce azo derivatives. This work paves the way for feasibly and effectively tuning the molecular adsorption conﬁguration on the solidliquid interfaces and promoting oxidative coupling reactions under an electrochemical environment. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2025, e202502724 1 of 11 2025 Wiley-VCH GmbH Research Article Results and Discussion Measurement of single-molecule conductance of 4-pyridin- 4-ylaniline with increasing volume ratio of HMIMPF6 ionic liquid. The adsorption conﬁguration of 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline on the Au surface was modulated by varying the volume ratio of HMIMPF6 VHMIMPF6 in the solvent Figure 1a. We used freshly prepared solutions for each experiment to avoid water contamination from the air Table S1. The single-molecule conductance measurement was performed at a 100 mV bias using a home-built STM-BJ instrument39 Figure S1. The Au tip was wrapped with wax to reduce leakage current, and the Au substrate was assembled with 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline by dropping the solution. We ﬁrst performed the single-molecule conductance mea- surements with the pure solvents without any target molecule. In particular, the pure PC solvent, 10 HMIMPF6 solvent, and 100 HMIMPF6 solvent. As given in Figure S2, no conductance signal was found in either the one-dimensional 1D conductance histograms or the two-dimensional 2D conductance-distance histograms. The snap-back distance of Au-Au was determined to be 0.5 nm, which agrees with the previous reports.40 We measured the single-molecule conductance of 10 mM 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecules dissolved in different sol- vents. There was a weak conductance signal of the 4-pyridin- 4-ylaniline found in pure PC solution Figure 1b,c. We supposed it is the ﬂat adsorption conﬁguration of 4-pyridine- 4-ylaniline molecules dominated by Au-π interaction that contributed to it Figures S3 and S4. Interestingly, distinct peaks emerged in the 1D conductance histograms as the VHMIMPF6 was increased from 10 to 80 Figures 1b, S5S7. When VHMIMPF6 is 10, the distinct conductance values of 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecule are 103.16 G0 high conductance, GH and",

Interestingly, distinct peaks emerged in the 1D conductance histograms as the VHMIMPF6 was increased from 10 to 80 Figures 1b, S5S7. When VHMIMPF6 is 10, the distinct conductance values of 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecule are 103.16 G0 high conductance, GH and 104.46 G0 low conductance, GL, where G0 2e2h is the quantum of conductance.40,41 GH and GL correspond to the Au-π and Au-σ interaction between the molecule and electrodes, respectively, as illustrated later. The corresponding 2D conductance-distance histograms showed two distinct clouds of conductance distributions Figures 1d, S8S10. When VHMIMPF6 reached 100, only a GL state was exhibited in the 1D conductance histograms Figures 1b, S6 and S7 and the 2D conductance-distance histograms Figures 1e, S9 and S10. To investigate the conﬁguration of 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecular junctions, we analyzed the statistical distribution of plateau length of molecular junctions with GH and GL states. As shown in the inset of Figure 1d, the statistical distribution of the plateau length of the GH state, as calibrated by the snap- back distance 0.5 nm, is 0.65 nm as VHMIMPF6 is 10.40 The statistical distribution of plateau length is much shorter than the simulated molecular junction length of 0.98 nm Figure S11, suggesting a tilt adsorption conﬁguration of molecules on the Au surface.42,43 The calibrated statistical distribution of the plateau length of the GL state is about 0.83 nm, which is consistent with the length of an upright adsorption conﬁguration with Au-σ dominated interaction. Furthermore, it is found that the value of GH decreased from 103.16 G0 to 103.26 G0 with increasing VHMIMPF6 Figure 1f, and the corresponding statistical distribution of plateau length increased approaching the value of an upright molecular junction Figure 1h, pink ball. It can be seen that the GH state corresponds to the tilt adsorption conﬁguration with the Au-π dominated interaction, and the interaction decreases as VHMIMPF6 rises. The GL increased from 104.46 G0 to 103.61 G0 with increasing VHMIMPF6 Figure 1g. The calibrated statistical distribution of plateau length maintained around 0.83 nm Figure 1h, indicating a stable upright adsorption conﬁguration for the GL. The increase of the GL may be caused by the decreased torsion angle between the benzene and the pyridine of 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecules. Previous studies demonstrated that ionic liquids can alter the torsion angle of π-conjugated molecules,44 and that a smaller torsion angle leads to greater conductance.45 More details of the statistical distribution of plateau length are shown in Figures S12S17. Characterization of molecular adsorption conﬁguration with increasing volume ratio of HMIMPF6 ionic liquid. We measured the contact angles to explore the mechanism regulating molecular adsorption conﬁguration on the Au surface by HMIMPF6 ionic liquid. As shown in Figure 2a, when 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline is dissolved in pure PC sol- vent, the contact angle of the solution is 9, indicating a good wettability on the Au surface.46 In 10 HMIMPF6 solution, the contact angle of 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline solution increased to 16. Finally, it increased to 28 as VHMIMPF6 continuously reached 100, indicating",

Finally, it increased to 28 as VHMIMPF6 continuously reached 100, indicating the reduction of interactions between 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecules and Au surface.47,48 Previous studies demonstrated the solution wettability would increase when the conjugation plane of the molecules dissolved therein is oriented to be parallel to the substrate.49 Based on the data of Figure 2a, we hypothesized that the evolution of molecular conﬁguration from the ﬂat to upright ones increased the contact angle of the solution. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy SERS was uti- lized to characterize the molecule-Au interaction using 50 nm Au nanoparticles Figures 2b, S18. Firstly, as control experiments, we collected the Raman spectra of 4-pyridin- 4-ylaniline powder and pure solvents Figure S19. In the SERS signals collected in 10 HMIMPF6 solution Figure 2c, the characteristic peaks differ from that of the powder sample and the pure solvent. We found the peaks at 1017 and 1036 cm1 are ascribed to the ring breathing mode V1 and symmetric ring deformation mode V12 of the adsorbed pyridine.50,51 A splitting peak is found at the wavenumber of 1638 cm1 assigned to parallel CC stretch V8a, which is due to the strong Au-π interaction between the pyridine ring of the 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecule and the Au surface.15,52 Thus, the vibration mode of V1 and V12 of the adsorbed pyridine and a splitting peak from V8a can be used as an indicator for studying the interaction between adsorbed 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecule and the Au surface. To investigate the evolution of interaction between the adsorbed 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecule and the Au, we measured the SERS signals of 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline adsorbed on Au surface in the PC solution with increasing addition of VHMIMPF6 Figure 2c. As VHMIMPF6 increased, the intensity of the V8a gradually weakened Figure 2d, pink Angew. Chem. Int.

The results demonstrated a reduction of the Au-π interaction between the pyridine in the 4- pyridin-4-ylaniline molecule and the Au surface, leading to the conductance decay of the Au-π interaction dominated molecular junctions of GH state Figure 1f. We measure the UVvis absorption spectra to investi- gate the inﬂuence of ionic liquids on 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecule. We conducted absorption spectroscopy tests on molecular solutions with different VHMIMPF6 using quartz colorimetric dishes. The collection range of the absorption spectrum is set from 350 to 500 nm. As shown in Figure 2e, 4- pyridin-4-ylaniline molecule exhibited an absorption peak of 393 nm belonging to the π-π transition,54,55 and the intensity of this absorption peak gradually decreases with the increasing VHMIMPF6. To study the mechanism of the HMIMPF6-dependent evo- lution of adsorption conﬁguration for 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline, we performed high-resolution XPS. More details of the XPS sample preparations are shown in Figure S20. Figure 2f gives the XPS results of 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline monolayers on Au substrates prepared with different solvents. For the 4-pyridin- 4-ylaniline molecules on the Au surface formed in pure PC solution, the binding energy of Au is 87.68 and 84.02 eV Figure 2f, top, corresponding to Au 4f52 and 4f72 orbitals.

These results are consistent with the previous reports.56,57 For the 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecules on the Au surface formed at 10 HMIMPF6 solution, the binding energy of Au 4f52 and 4f72 increases to 87.95 and 84.26 eV Figure 2f, middle, respectively, indicating an increase of the positive charge on the Au surface.56,57 The increase in binding energy suggests the reduction of electron density on the Au surface. For the 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecules on the Au surface formed in 100 HMIMPF6 solution, the binding energy of Au further increases to 88.24 and 84.51 eV Figure 2f, bottom. In brief, in pure PC solution, 10 HMIMPF6 solution, and 100 HMIMPF6 solution, Au 4f binding energy increases in turn, indicating the decrease of electron density of Au surface. The corresponding binding energy of C 1s is presented in Figure 2g. In pure PC solution, for the 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecules adsorbing on Au substrates, the binding energies of C 1s are 284.8 and 286.71 eV, derived from the peak of CC and CNCN bond, respectively.58,59 At 10 HMIMPF6 solution, the CNCN bonds of molecules moved to a lower binding energy 286.55 eV, derived from pyridine N, indicating electron density of molecule increased.59 This may weaken the interaction between the molecules and the Au electrode surface. In the 100 HMIMPF6 solution, the binding energy of CNCN bonds of molecules further moved to the lower binding energy of 286.43 eV, which means the molecule has more negative charge. The binding energy of N 1s located at 399.0 and 402.1 eV Figure 2h correspond to pyridine N and amino N, respectively.58,59 It is found that with the increasing VHMIMPF6, these two characteristic binding energies shifted to the lower binding energy. The result indicated the electron density on the 4- pyridin-4-ylaniline molecules gradually increased.57 The above results revealed that HMIMPF6 led to the transfer of electrons from the Au surface to the molecules and reduced the electron density of the Au surface. In brief, the Au-π interaction between molecules and the Au surface is weakened, leading to the molecular adsorption conﬁguration from ﬂat Au-π dominated interaction to the coexistence of tilt Au-π dominated interaction and upright Au-σ dominated interaction and ﬁnally to upright. To further reveal the dominant charge transport pathway through the molecular junctions, we performed the ﬂicker noise analysis on the GH and GL states. If the noise power scales is close to the results of G1.0, the charge transport through a molecular junction is dominated by through-bond coupling transmission, while the noise power scales is close to the results of G2.0, the charge transport is the through-space coupling transmission.60 In the constructed 2D histograms of the noise power spectral density PSD Figures 2i,j, S21, the noise power scales for 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline junctions with GH and GL state are G1.73 Figure 2i and G1.14 Figure 2j, respectively.

The results indicate that the charge transport pathway is dominated by the through-space coupling of Au- π interaction in the GH state and the through-bond coupling of Au-σ interaction in the GL state.61,62 To further reveal the relationship between the GH and GL states, we carried out the 2D cross-correlation analysis. Although the two conductance states exhibited a negative correlation feature in the 2D cross-correlation histograms Figures 2k, S22, it does not mean that GH will not evolve into GL in our experiments. Detailed analysis demonstrated that the negative correlation stems from the absence of simultaneous long plateaus for both GH and GL Figures S23 and S24.63 The result of the correlation analysis is consistent with the changes in the adsorption conﬁguration proposed above.

As presented in Figure 3b, for 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecules dissolved in the 100 HMIMPF6 solution, the molecule exhibited a conductance of 104.06 G0 when the electrochemical potential was 0.1 V, which implies that the molecule has an upright adsorption conﬁguration on the Au surface. As the potential increased from 0.1 to 0.5 V Figures S25 and S26 the conductance rose from 104.06 G0 0.1 V to 103.80 G0 0.5 V. When the potential increased to 0.7 V, the conductance almost remained constant. When the potential increased from 0.1 to 0.4 V, the plateau length remained 0.82 nm Figures 3c, S27, which agrees with the 4-pyridin-4- ylaniline molecular junctions with the upright conﬁguration on the Au surface Figures 1e, S11. However, the plateau length decreased to 0.68 nm when the potential increased to 0.5 V. As the potential increased from 0.5 to 0.7 V, it remained constant Figures 3c, S27. These values are similar to the 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecular junctions with the tilt adsorption conﬁguration on the Au surface Figures 1d, S12S17. The plateau length differed from those of the azo molecules Figure S28, demonstrating that the oxidative coupling reaction did not occur under the conditions. This observation is attributed to the change of the interfacial structure of HMIMPF6 at different potentials, which led to the changes in molecule conﬁguration.28 For 4-pyridin-4- ylaniline molecules dissolved at 10 HMIMPF6 solution, when the electrochemical potential was 0.1 V, there were two conductance states at 103.23 G0 GH and 104.60 G0 GL Figure 3d, top, with plateau lengths of 0.69 and 0.83 nm Figure 3e, top, respectively, corresponding to the tilt and upright conﬁgurations of 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecules. The two conductances remained constant until the electrochemical potential increased to 0.5 V and a new ultra- low conductance GUltra-L of 105.63 G0 appeared Figures 3d, middle, S29 and S30, which indicates that the azo product of 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline formed.34 The calibrated plateau length of GUltra-L is 1.10 nm Figure 3e, middle, which is consistent with the molecule length of the cis-azo product Figure S28.

Interestingly, as the potential increased to 0.6 V, only the GH 103.09 G0 and GUltra-L 105.61 G0 states were detected Figure 3d, bottom, while the GL state disappeared, indicating that all 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecules with upright conﬁguration are consumed involved in the formation of cis-azo product. More details of the 1D conductance histograms, the statistical distribution of plateau length, and the 2D conductance-distance histograms of 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecules reacted at different elec- trochemical potentials in 10 HMIMPF6 solution are shown in Figures S29S31. To rule out that the conductance signal of the reac- tion product molecules formed during our measurement from trans-azo product, we measured the conductance of trans-1,2-bis4-pyridin-4-ylphenyldiazene dissolved in 10 HMIMPF6 solution as control. It is found that the conduc- tance of the target molecule is 104.78 G0 at the potential of 0.5 V, with a plateau length of 1.76 nm Figure S32, which is different from the results of the reaction product molecules at 105.63 G0 and 1.10 nm Figure 3d,e, middle, respectively. To prove the reaction product is cis-azo, we conducted the photoisomerization investigation of trans-1,2-bis4-pyridin- 4-ylphenyldiazene at the bias of 0.1 V without electrochem- ical potential Figure S33. Under 473 nm laser irradiation, the conductance remained at 104.79 G0, and the calibrated plateau length remained at 1.73 nm Figure S33. In contrast, under 405 nm laser irradiation, the trans-azo molecules transformed into cis-azo molecules by photoisomerization, in which case the conductance evolved to 105.61 G0 and the plateau length evolved to 1.12 nm Figure S33. These two values are consistent with the results we obtained that 105.63 G0 and 1.10 nm Figure 3d,e, middle, conﬁrming that the product is cis-azo. The results of the electrochemical reaction of 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline at VHMIMPF6 15, 20 are shown in Figures S34S41. To further demonstrate the inﬂuence of HMIMPF6- regulated molecular conﬁguration on reaction, we carried out the single-molecule electrochemical oxidative coupling reaction of 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline in pure PC solution. Two conductances appeared at 103.33 G0 GH and 104.68 G0 GL under the electrochemical potential of 0.1 V Figure 3f, top, with the calibrated plateau lengths of 0.66 and 0.81 nm Figure 3g, top, respectively. These corresponded to the tilt 0.65 nm and upright 0.83 nm conﬁgurations of 4-pyridin- 4-ylaniline molecules on the Au surface Figure 1d,e. The two conductances remained constant as the potential increased from 0.1 to 0.7 V Figure S42. When the electro- chemical potential increased to 0.8 V, a new conductance state appeared at 105.67 G0 Figure 3f, bottom, with the calibrated plateau length of 1.13 nm Figure 3g, bottom.

We found that the Raman peaks of the commercial azo 1,2-bis4-pyridin- 4-ylphenyldiazene were located at 1145, 1391, 1423, 1455 and 1602 cm1 Figures 3h, S17. Among them, 1145 and 1455 cm1 peaks are attributed to the azo groups NN stretching VN N and the CN stretching VCN.38,65 The 1391 and 1423 cm1 peaks are derived from NN stretch- ing coupled with CC stretching VCC, and 1602 cm1 originates from CC stretching.66 For the products in 10 HMIMPF6 solution Figure 3h, pink curve and the 100 PC solution Figure 3h, green curve, the same characteristic SERS peaks of 1,2-bis4-pyridin-4-ylphenyldiazene are observed marked with the light blue shaded areas, indi- cating the formation of azo product. However, there are no characteristic peaks of azo molecules found in the 100 HMIMPF6 solution after single-molecule electrochemical measurement Figure 3h, gray curve, which supports the absence of azo product signals in the above conductance tests Figure 3b,c. Theoretical simulations of molecular adsorption and electron transport. We carried out the density functional theory DFT calculations to investigate the inﬂuence of HMIMPF6 on the adsorption conﬁguration of 4-pyridin- 4-ylaniline molecules. We ﬁrst optimized the adsorption conﬁguration of 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecules on Au111 surface in different environments, including pure PC solution, 10 HMIMPF6 solution, and 100 HMIMPF6 solution, respectively Figure 4ac, left. It can be seen that the tilt angle θ increases successively as VHMIMPF6 increases, where θ denoted the angle between the AuN bond and the pyridine plane π-system. With the introduction of HMIMPF6, the conﬁguration of the 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecule gradually changed from ﬂat to tilt and ﬁnally reached the upright conﬁguration. The corresponding elec- tron localization function ELF Figure 4ac, right shows that the HMIMPF6 effectively reduces the electron density of the Au electrode surface, which agrees with the changes in the binding energy in XPS experiments Figure 2f. The transmission coefﬁcients were calculated to gain further insight into the inﬂuence of the θ on the molecular conductance. Figure 4d gives the optimized 4-pyridin-4- ylaniline molecular junctions at different θ. The correspond- ing transmission coefﬁcients were shown in Figure 4e, which decreased gradually with the tilt angle. As shown in Figure 4f, the conductance of a tilt conﬁguration is greater than that of an upright conﬁguration. The evolution of calculated conductance is consistent with the trend of our experimen- tal results Figure 1f. Figure 4g gives the corresponding transmission eigenstates of 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecular junction. As the θ increases, the overlapping area of the metal and the molecule becomes smaller, indicating the coupling between the molecule and the metal weakens, further leading to a decrease in molecular conductance Figure 4f.67 In particular, as the θ",

    "text": "4g gives the corresponding transmission eigenstates of 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecular junction. As the θ increases, the overlapping area of the metal and the molecule becomes smaller, indicating the coupling between the molecule and the metal weakens, further leading to a decrease in molecular conductance Figure 4f.67 In particular, as the θ increases from 40 to 90, the molecule- electrode coupling evolves from Au-π dominated to Au-σ dominated, during which the Au-π interaction between molecules and electrodes gradually weakens.67 Furthermore, we performed calculations for transmis- sion curves for the single-molecule junctions of cis-1,2- bis4-pyridin-4-ylphenyldiazene cis-molecule and trans- 1,2-bis4-pyridin-4-ylphenyldiazene trans-molecule. As shown in Figure 4h, the calculated conductance of the trans- molecule is higher than that of the cis-molecule, which is consistent with the results of our experimental measure- ments. We further excluded the possibility of the π-stacking dimer formation in the GL state during the electrochemical reaction through photoluminescence measurements Figures S47S49. Combined with all the experimental and theoretical calculation results, we proposed the mechanism diagram in Figure 4i that the HMIMPF6 can effectively change the inter- action between molecules and the Au surface and regulate the adsorption conﬁguration of molecules. We can achieve the regulation of single-molecule adsorption conﬁguration on the Au electrode from ﬂat to tilt and ﬁnally upright Figure 4i, I- IV by increasing the VHMIMPF6. The molecular adsorption conﬁguration directly affects the oxidative coupling reaction Figure 4i, V-VIII. In particular, only upright molecules can trigger the oxidative coupling reaction of 4-pyridin- 4-ylaniline molecules at the electrochemical potential and obtain the azo derivatives. Conclusion In summary, this work revealed the evolution of the adsorp- tion conﬁguration of 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecules with ionic liquid at the single-molecule level and achieved the acceleration of electrochemical oxidative coupling. With the help of XPS and Raman measurements, it was found that the electron density of the Au surface was reduced by introducing the HMIMPF6. The reduced electron density of the Au surface changed the interaction between 4-pyridin- 4-ylaniline molecules and the Au surface gradually from Au-π dominated to Au-σ dominated coupling, resulting in the adsorption conﬁguration of 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecules from ﬂat to upright. It is observed that only the upright adsorption conﬁguration of 4-pyridin-4-ylaniline molecules can trigger the oxidative coupling reaction and that HMIMPF6 can reduce the required electrochemical potential during oxidative coupling reactions. The DFT calculation demonstrated that HMIMPF6 could effectively decrease the electron density of the solidliquid interfaces and change the adsorption conﬁguration of 4-pyridin-4- ylaniline molecules. This work provides an approach for studying the mechanisms of molecular reactions involved with the solidliquid interfaces at the single-molecule level. It has the potential for controlling chemical reactions, regulating interfacial molecular adsorption, and advancing applications in biology, medicine, and energy.

Xu, and Yida Deng Cite This: https:doi.org10.1021jacs.4c18550 Read Online ACCESS Metrics More Article Recommendations sı Supporting Information ABSTRACT: Spin state of active sites is one of the most influencing factors for the catalytic performance of electrocatalysts. To date, most modulations are conducted on non-tetrahedrally coordinated metal sites, while tetrahedron- coordinated single-atom catalysts TCSACs have not been investigated yet. This article presents a correlation between the spin state of TCSACs and their activities toward CO2 electroreduction. TCSACs are made using ZnO as the substrate. The spin states of metal sites of TCSACs modulate the interactions between the catalyst and adsorbed intermediates. A volcano relationship is found between the transition metal TM magnetic moments and the limiting potential UL of the CO2 reduction reaction. Spin-state analysis indicates that the intermediate spin state of TMs is more favorable for the adsorption and conversion of CO2. Optimal interaction between the TM-t2 orbitals of the intermediate spin and the adsorbed molecule-pz orbitals significantly improves the catalytic activity of the TCSACs. As a result, Fe-TCSAC achieves a high FECO of 91.6 at 0.9 V vs RHE. These results provide a theoretical basis and guidelines for the spin-state effects of tetrahedron-coordinated single-atom catalysts. INTRODUCTION Single-atom catalysts SACs have received great attention in electrocatalysis due to the advantages, such as high atom utilization rate and well-defined active sites.1,2 Structural design and electronic modulation are crucial for tuning the perform- ance of the SACs. Spin state is a quantum property determined by the number of unpaired electrons and spin arrangements at the active sites, which directly determines the electronic structure of catalysts.3,4 3d transition metal TM cations contain abundant d-orbital electron-filled states. Therefore, studying the effects of 3d TM spin state on the electrocatalytic performance of SACs has been an interest of the community.511 The crystal field environment determines the spin states at the metal centers and consequently the distribution of electrons in their d-orbitals.4 In catalysts such as layered bimetallic hydroxides, transition metal oxides, chalcocites, spinels, and MOFs, the spin state of Co, Fe, and Mn ions has been reported playing an important role in achieving excellent catalytic performance.9 Octahedral geometry is the most common structural configuration in these metal compounds. The high symmetry and geometrical stability make them often studied with spin state effects. In perovskite cobaltates e.g., LaCoO3 and spinel cobaltates e.g., Co3O4, octahedrally coordinated Co3 usually has a low-spin LS state t2g 6 eg 0. The σ-bonding between Co-eg orbitals and oxygen-containing intermediates affects the reaction performance of the oxygen evolution reaction OER.12 The best OER performance is achieved when the half-full eg orbitals of Co3 in the octahedra optimally interact with the adsorbed intermediates.13 Notably, the energy levels of split d-orbitals are t2g dxy, dyz, dxz eg dx 2y 2, dz 2 in octahedral field, while those in the tetrahedral field are opposing, e dx 2y 2,",

More high-energy d-orbitals near the Fermi level provide more opportunities to interact with reactants and intermediates and thus offer better capability of tuning the catalytic performance. Therefore, the spin-state effect of the metal centers in the tetrahedral sites is expected to provide new opportunities for high performance. The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction CO2RR has been one of the greatest interests in catalysis research due to its potential in converting carbon dioxide into valuable chemicals and fuels using renewable electricity directly.14,15 The exploration of reaction mechanisms and the design of catalyst materials play crucial roles in electrocatalysis Received: December 26, 2024 Revised: May 11, 2025 Accepted: May 13, 2025 Article pubs.acs.orgJACS XXXX American Chemical Society A https:doi.org10.1021jacs.4c18550 J.

In this work, we investigate the spin-state effects of tetrahedron-coordinated single-atom catalysts on the CO2RR. The 3d TM TM Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu are introduced into tetrahedron-coordinated ZnO to form TCSACs. The effects of the spin state on the CO2RR properties of TCSACs are systematically analyzed. Different spin states result in varied degrees of interaction between the TM-d orbitals and the adsorbed molecule-p orbitals. The high-energy t2 level of the tetrahedrally positioned TM is more favorable for regulating CO2 molecule activation and conversion. Figure 1b. In the reduction of CO2 to CO, the adsorption energy of CO shows a volcano relationship with the limiting potential UL. Among the evaluated TCSACs, Fe-TCSAC is at the top of the volcano Figure 1.

With its intermediate spin IS state, the Fe-TCSAC exhibits moderate binding strength to the CO molecule. The active center of TMSACs with more unpaired electrons is more favorable for intermediate trans- formation. Furthermore, Fe-TCSAC exhibits excellent per- formance for electrocatalytic CO2RR FECO of 91.6 at 0.9 V vs RHE. Effective magnetic moments of TCSACs associated with spin states are consistent with theoretical calculations. This work provides in-depth insight into the effect of spin state on the coupling mechanism between t2 and p orbitals in tetrahedron-coordinated catalysts. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The design strategy of TCSACs is first proposed. For the construction of TCSACs, ZnO with tetrahedral coordination was selected as the substrate. The density functional theory DFT calculations were used to assess the effect of spin state in CO2 conversion in TCSACs. The relevant optimization parameters and the configurational information on the TCSACs are all provided in the Supporting Information. To ensure the reasonableness of the calculation parameters, cutoff energy, k-mesh, and Ueff, are evaluated Figures S3S6.21 The crystal facet of ZnO plays an important role in its catalytic performance. The ZnO mainly exposes the 110, 101, 001, and 100 crystal facets.2225 The DFT calculations results show that the ZnO001 crystal facet exhibits the lowest surface energy 0.42 Jm2 Figure S1, which is consistent with previous research results.23,26 Therefore, ZnO001 is selected as the simulation model in this work. The surface energies of four terminal structures of the ZnO100 were calculated Figure S2. The results show that the Zn-terminated ZnO001 surface with different top and bottom surface atoms has the lowest surface energy 0.46 Jm2. 3d transition metal TM Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu atom was substituted for the Zn atom of ZnO to form TCSACs Figure 1c. The formation energies of TM-TCSACs were calculated to estimate the thermodynamic stability of TM-TCSACs on both O and Zn terminations. The Zn- terminated TM-TCSACs with more negative formation energy values show higher thermodynamic stability Figure 1d. The thermodynamic stabilities of TCSACs were further verified by the binding energies of TM on ZnO Figure S8. The Mn- TCSAC 3.71 eV and Fe-TCSAC 3.70 eV exhibit lower binding energies.

The Mn- TCSAC 3.71 eV and Fe-TCSAC 3.70 eV exhibit lower binding energies. As the first step involved in CO2RR, the adsorption of CO2 molecules is often regarded as a key reference criterion for assessing the feasibility of the reaction. The adsorption of CO2 molecules is more accessible on Zn- terminated TCSACs, except for the Cu-TCSAC Figure 1e. Meanwhile, the adsorption strength of the Cu-TCSAC on CO2 is weaker than other TCSACs, suggesting that spinless elements are less effective in enhancing the CO2RR on TM- TCSACs. The excellent catalytic efficiency of SACs is primarily attributed to their unique electronic structure. In particular, the charge distribution around the active sites is crucial for facilitating the adsorption and activation of CO2. Differential charge density analysis reveals that TM-TCSACs with varying spin states transfer different amounts of charge to the coupled O atoms Figure 1f. The Bader charge transfer quantities follow the order Fe 1.21 e Mn 1.16 e Co 0.96 e Cu 0.56 e Ni 0.54 e. It indicates that the Fe-TCSAC possesses the strongest electron transfer capacity. Besides, significant charge transfer occurs on the CO2 surfaces of Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni-TCSACs compared to the Zn-TCSAC, showing depletion of charge near the TM atoms and accumlation of electrons near the oxygen atoms Figures S11 and S12, Table S1. However, there is almost no charge transfer between the C atom of adsorbed CO2 and the Cu- TCSAC surface. Thus, based on the analysis of structural stability and electron transfer ability, Mn-, Fe-, Co-, and Ni- TCSAC can be identified as potentially excellent catalysts for CO2RR. Numerous studies have reported that the degree of coupling between TM-d orbitals and the p orbitals of CO2 bonding atoms is a key indicator of their interaction strength.2729 The bonding mechanism of adsorbed molecules with TM atoms is investigated through the density of states DOS Figure S13. The analysis focuses on the distribution of electrons near the Fermi level and the p-d orbitals coupling. Compared to the ZnO, the spin splitting of TM atoms in TCSACs leads to a redistribution of the electronic states on the p orbital of the CO2O1 atom. The associated electron transfer can facilitate the activation and conversion of CO2. Moreover, the Fe-t2 dxy, dyz, dxz orbitals exhibit strong coupling with the O-py, pz orbitals near the Fermi energy level 1.23 eV, resulting in a more stable FeO bond compared to Co and Mn. The stronger coupling can be attributed to the unique tetrahedral configuration of the Fe-TCSAC, where the t2 orbitals are more active due to their higher energy levels relative to those of the e orbitals. It explains the stronger CO2 adsorption on Fe-TCSAC see the SI for further details. These results indicate that TM atoms with varying spin states can induce a redistribution of the charge at the interface of TCSACs, which influences the adsorption",

These results indicate that TM atoms with varying spin states can induce a redistribution of the charge at the interface of TCSACs, which influences the adsorption strength of the CO2 molecules at the TCSAC surface. Besides, the spin state of TCSACs is determined by the number and corresponding arrangements of unpaired electrons. The concept of magnetic moment magmom, which quantifies the number of unpaired electrons, was introduced to facilitate the study of spin states.30,31 The magnitude value increases with the number of unpaired electrons. By setting and optimizing magmom of materials, the magnetic ground state can be obtained Figure S7. The spin electron arrangement of the magnetic ground state profoundly affects the catalytic properties of the material. We found that TM-TCSACs with zero magmom do not follow the magmom-related performance trends, so the elements with zero magmom are not explored subsequently. The calculated spin magnitudes of Mn-, Fe-, Co-, and Ni-TCSACs are 4.58, 3.71, 2.57, and 0.99 μB, respectively. A volcano relationship is observed between the magnitude of the TM and the adsorption energy of CO2 on TM-TCSACs. The Fe- TCSAC located at the peak of the volcano plot exhibits the strongest CO2 adsorption strength Figure 1g. Moreover, it was shown that the trend of the CO2 adsorption energy of TCSACs under explicit solvation remained constant Figure S9. To gain deeper insights into the bonding strength between the adsorbed CO2 molecule and the TCSAC, a Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population COHP analysis was conducted. The higher the absolute value of the integrated COHP iCOHP, the stronger the bonding interaction between TM of TCSACs and adsorption molecules. The integrated pCOHP ipCOHP values of the Zn-, Mn-, Fe-, Co-, and NiO1 bonds are 0.61, 0.81, 0.94, 0.80, and 0.76 eV, respectively, demonstrating that Mn, Fe, and Co atoms enhance the interaction between the catalysts and the CO2 molecule Figure 1h.

The Gibbs free energies of the electroreduction of CO2 on the TCSACs are shown in Figure 2a, and related details are provided in Table S2. The potential-determining step PDS of Zn-TCSAC, Fe-TCSAC, and Mn-TCSAC is COOH to CO. UL was obtained from the maximum ΔG ΔGmax of each elementary step. Compared to the ZnO substrate 1.10 eV, the UL for CO2 conversion to CO decreases to 0.57 and 0.94 eV on Fe-TCSAC and Mn-TCSAC, respectively. However, the PDS of Co-, Ni-, and Cu-TCSACs is the desorption of CO as the COg. The UL values of the Co- TCSAC, Ni-TCSAC, and Cu-TCSAC are 0.96, 1.13, and 0.82 eV, respectively, indicating that Co-TCSAC and Cu-TCSAC show excellent performance",

The UL values of the Co- TCSAC, Ni-TCSAC, and Cu-TCSAC are 0.96, 1.13, and 0.82 eV, respectively, indicating that Co-TCSAC and Cu-TCSAC show excellent performance for the reduction of CO2 to CO. Due to its limited ability to adsorb CO2, Cu-TCSAC is not regarded as an efficient catalyst for CO2RR. Interestingly, a volcano relationship is observed between the UL and CO adsorption energy. Fe-TCSACs with a maximum UL value is located at the volcano peak Figure 2b. It is mainly due to the fact that the interaction strength between CO and the TCSACs strongly influences the PDS of the conversion of CO2 to CO. For TCSACs with weak CO adsorption, the PDS involves the conversion of COOH to CO. In contrast, for TCSACs with strong CO adsorption, the PDS shifts to the desorption of CO as COg. Therefore, the interaction of CO with TCSACs is critical to the PDS in the CO2RR process. To investigate the origin of the catalytic activity of TCSACs, the tetrahedral geometrical configuration and electronic structure were further analyzed. Figure 2c shows the reaction mechanism for the conversion of CO2 to CO. The CO2 and COOH tend to adsorb on the TM sites of the TCSACs, revealing the role of the TM sites on the activation of CO2 over TCSACs Figure S15. As a key intermediate, CO tends to adsorb on TM sites. In addition, Ni- and Cu-TCSACs Figure 2.

Based on the above results regarding catalyst stability and CO2RR activity, it can be concluded that there is relatively limited catalytic performance of Ni and Cu-TCSACs. Since the Cu-TCSAC magnetic moment is zero, it is not involved in the subsequent magnetic moment-related dis- cussion. The CO moiety in the CO is polarized by the TM, causing spin-charge accumulation around the TM and resulting in a reduction of the TM magnitude Figure 2e. The calculated magnitudes of TM atoms in TCSACs are Mn 4.58 μB, Fe 3.71 μB, Co 2.57 μB, and Ni 0.99 μB, which show an inverted volcano relationship with the -UL for CO2RR Figure 2f.

To further verify the volcano relationships between EadsCO and UL as well as magmom and -UL, more transition metals with nonzero magmom were calculated, including Cr, Nb, W, Nb, Mo, Tc, Rh, Ti, and Ta. The results show that Cr-, Nb-, W-, Nb-, Mo-, Tc-, Rh-, Ti-, and Ta-TCSACs follow the volcano relationship of EadsCO and UL Figure S21a as well as TM atoms magmom and -UL Figure S21b. The performance of other tetrahedron- coordinated TM-TCSACs TM Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni; TC ZnS, CdS, and SiO2 was further explored Figures S22 S25. The results show that the introduction of Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni significantly reduced the PDS of TCSACs TM Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni; TC ZnS, CdS, and SiO2 in the conversion of CO2 to CO. Fe-TCSACs TC ZnS, CdS, and SiO2 were consistently at the top of the UL and EadsCO Figure S26ac as well as TM atom magmom and -UL volcano relationship Figure S26df.

The morphologies of the as-prepared catalysts are charac- terized by scanning electron microscopy SEM and trans- mission electron microscopy TEM. The SEM Figure S28 and TEM Figures S29a32a images show that the ZnO exhibits nanoflower morphology, which is retained in Fe-, Mn-, and Co-TCSACs. The specific area, average pore size, and average particle size of the ZnO, Mn-, Fe-, and Co-TCSACs were measured by BrunnerEmmettTaylor BET. The adsorption and desorption isotherm curves for ZnO, Mn, Fe, and Co-TCSACs are shown in Figure S33. The type V isotherms are due to mesoporous in the structures. The BET surface areas of the ZnO, Mn-, Fe-, and Co-TCSACs were 18.50, 20.63, 19.39, and 19.77 m2g, respectively Table S5, showing similar values. The total pore volumes single-point method are 0.16, 0.19, 0.18, and 0.19 cm3g, indicating comparable pore volumes. Additionally, the BarrettJoyner Hallenda BJH adsorption average pore diameters of the ZnO-, Mn-, Fe-, and Co-TCSACs are 41.20, 35.71, 40.79, and 36.44 nm, respectively, all close to 40 nm Figure S34, suggesting a minimal variation in the mesopore size. The high- resolution transmission electron microscopy HRTEM image of Fe-TCSAC in Figure S30b displays a lattice spacing of 0.129 nm corresponding to the 004 facets. It agrees with the selected crystal facet in the theoretical calculation section. The SAED pattern of Fe-TCSAC displays 002, 103, and 110 facets Figure S30c. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope HAADF-STEM images and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy EDS elemental mapping images Figures S29df, S30d, and S31 32cf reveal that Fe, Mn, and O are uniformly distributed.

The positive shift in the Zn 2p32 and 2p12 binding energies represents an electron transfer from Zn to Fe, which can be attributed to the greater electronegativity of Fe3 1.83 compared to that of Zn2 1.65. To verify that the transition metal atoms were successfully introduced into ZnO, the electronic structure and local coordination environments of Fe-TCSACs were charac- terized using X-ray absorption near-edge structure XANES and extended X-ray absorption fine structure EXAFS.35,36 Figure 3c shows the Fe K-edge XANES spectrum of Fe- TCSAC along with the spectra of Fe foil, Fe2O3, and FeO as references. Fe-TCSAC has a near-edge structure similar to that of Fe2O3, indicating that the average valence state of Fe in Fe- TCSAC is close to 3. The Fe K-edge Fourier transform FT of the EXAFS spectrum R-space of Fe-TCSACs displays a main peak at 1.50 Å corresponding to FeO coordination and a peak at 2.70 Å associated with FeOZn coordination Figure 3d. No FeFe coordination is observed, indicating that Fe is distributed as single atoms on the ZnO substrate. The structural parameters were fitted to the XAFS data, demonstrating that Fe replaces the Zn sites in ZnO to form the TCSAC Figure S37. These structural characterization results are also in agreement with the model used in the theoretical calculations. To verify the spin redistribution phenomenon, zero-field cooling ZFC temperature-dependent magnetization χm measurements37 were performed to reveal the electron spin configurations in Mn-, Fe-, and Co-TCSAC. The effective magmom values μeff based on ZFC characterization of Mn, Fe, and Co in the prepared TCSACs are 4.56, 3.61, and 2.60 μB, respectively Figures 3e and S38. Specifically, the relationship between the number of unpaired d-electrons n and the magmom of the TM atom is determined using the following equation:1 n n 2 B eff . Calculation details are provided in the eqs 1517 of the Supporting Information. It is in agreement with the theoretical calculated magmom values Figure 3f. It also shows that the computational model and parameters are reliable.

However, the spin state of Mn atoms remains unchanged mainly attributed to the weak interaction of the Mn-TCSAC with CO. The number of unpaired d-electrons for Mn atoms remains constant throughout the reaction, consistently in a high spin HS state Figure 3g. The CO adsorption energy is linearly related to the magnetic moment of the TM on TM-TCSACs Figure S16a. Therefore, the CO adsorption mechanism was further elucidated by analyzing the DOS of the systems. Spin splitting is not observed in the DOS of the ZnO substrate, and the C-px and py orbitals are slightly coupled with Zn-dx 2y 2 and dz 2 in the unoccupied state. It indicates that CO is weakly adsorbed on the ZnO surface. The DOS of Mn-TCSAC shows similarity to the slight coupling of the p-d orbitals Figure S17. In contrast, in Fe-TCSAC, the Fe-d orbitals DOS shifts from the unoccupied to the occupied state, which causes the adsorbed C of CO to undergo spin splitting. Near the Fermi energy level 0.45 eV, the C-px and py orbitals of the spin-down bonding state exhibit enhanced coupling with Fe-dx 2y 2 and dz 2. Moreover, the spin-up C-pz orbitals are strongly coupled with the Fe-d orbitals, enhancing CFe interactions. It benefits CO activation and conversion, promoting the transition from COOH to CO Figure 3h. However, in Co-TCSACs, the strong coupling of the C-pz orbital with the Co-d orbitals provides a strong CO adsorption energy, which is unfavorable for CO desorption Figure S17.

The performance of TCSACs for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction was evaluated by a flow cell Figure S39. Figure 4a shows the total current densities of the TCSACs under different potentials from 0.5 to 1.0 V vs RHE. It demonstrates that Fe-TCSAC exhibits the highest current density at 1.0 V compared with the Mn-TCSAC, and Co- TCSAC. With increasing potential, the Faraday efficiency of CO FECO correspondingly increases, and the FECO of Fe- TCSACs reaches a maximum of 91.6 at a potential of 0.9 V Figure 4b. The Pourbaix diagram of the Fe-TCSAC shows that the structural stability of the Fe-TCSAC is maintained at pH 11 and an applied potential of 0.9 V to RHE Figure S40. The gas products of Fe-TCSAC were evaluated by online gas chromatography GC, as shown in Figure S41. Fe- TCSAC provides excellent selectivity for CO production, which is consistent with the results of the DFT calculations. The FEH2 values of the TCSACs are shown in Figure S42, demonstrating that Fe-TCSAC has the lowest FEH2 value compared with ZnO, Mn-TCSAC, and Co-TCSAC. Moreover, the CO partial current density of the Fe-TCSAC reaches a maximum value of 46.43 mA cm2 at 1.0 V Figure 4c. The electrochemically active surface areas ECSAs of different samples were then investigated by measuring the double-layer capacitance Cdl. Figure S43 presents the CV curves of ZnO, Fe-, Mn-, and Co-TCSAC. Fe-TCSAC exhibits the highest Cdl 0.16 mF cm2, compared to ZnO, Mn-TCSAC, and Co- TCSAC 0.12, 0.124, and 0.12 mF cm2, respectively Figure S44a. The relatively larger Cdl of Fe-TCSAC implies a higher electrochemically accessible surface area. While we acknowl- edge that the electrochemical surface area ECSA measure- ments may not take into account the exact conditions of gas access within the triple-phase boundary region during the CO2RR, its influence on the difference in activity should be negligible because all catalysts have similar morphology and surface chemistry. After normalization by the ECSA, the CO current densities of the four catalysts at different voltages still showed a similar trend, suggesting that the increase in catalyst activity may mainly stem from the enhancement of intrinsic activity Figure S44b. The ECSA normalized current density for the CO of Fe-TCSAC reaches a maximum value of 23.22 mA cm2. The trend of current density after BET normal- ization is consistent with the current density performance under a geometric area Figure S45. In addition, the long-term stability of the Fe-TCSAC at 0.9 V was investigated.

Compared with conventional ZnO-based catalysts,38 Fe-TCSAC, as an inexpensive catalyst, has a comparable FE. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy FTIR measurements were performed to identify the reaction intermediates involved in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO Tables S7 and S8. As displayed in Figure 4g, the Fe- TCSAC displays an absorption band with a vibration frequency of 1393 cm1, which is ascribed to the presence of a key COOH in the electrocatalytic CO2RR process. This absorption band shows an intensity higher than that of ZnO Figure 4f. Thus, in situ FTIR analysis demonstrates that the CO2 absorbed on the surface of the Fe-TCSAC is more favorably converted into surface COOH, facilitating the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. The HER always acts as a competing reaction to the CO2RR. The Gibbs free energies of the HER of the TCSACs were calculated Figure 4h. The absolute values of the HER reaction energy for Mn-, Fe-, Co-, Cu-TCSACs, and ZnO substrates are 0.96, 0.72, 1.06, 0.82, and 1.25 eV, respectively, which are all higher than those of CO2RR PDS. Thus, the competitive HER reaction is inhibited on TCSACs. In addition, HCOOH is significantly less selective than CO Figure S19. The dynamic stability of the structure was first assessed by using ab initio molecular dynamics AIMD simulations, revealing that the structure remains stable at room temperature for 10 ps Figure 4i. Mn- and Co-TCSACs also exhibit dynamic stability at room temperature Figure S20. To align more closely to the experimental conditions, the performance of the Fe-TCSAC was investigated with implicit solvents under constant-potential conditions. The Fe-TCSAC structure containing the implicit solvent was relaxed to reach equilibrium. Subsequently, the PDS i.e., the conversion of COOH to CO of the reactions in constant charge states was studied under a constant potential. The potential- dependent free energy profiles over the Fe-TCSAC at potentials of U 0, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 V were calculated Figure 4j. At a constant charge state U 0 V, the conversion of COOH to CO must overcome a reaction energy of 0.57 eV. However, in a constant-potential state of U 0.4 to 0.8 V, the PDS reaction energy decreases, and the reaction transitions from endothermic to spontaneous exothermic. With increasing voltage, the conversion of COOH to CO becomes more exothermic, facilitating the reaction.

XXXX, XXX, XXXXXX H constant-potential experimental conditions applying a voltage greater than 0.4 V allows for the spontaneous conversion of COOH to CO. The above results suggest an intrinsic source of robust stability and high CO selectivity on IS Fe-TCSACs. CONCLUSIONS In summary, the spin-state effect of TCSACs on the electroreduction of CO2 has been systematically investigated. The results show that TM single atoms at tetrahedral positions effectively regulate the adsorption and activation of CO2 molecules due to their higher t2 energy levels and more unoccupied orbitals. The TM magnetic moments and UL of the CO2RR exhibit a volcano relationship. The introduction of the spin state in Fe-TCSAC reduces the UL of CO2RR on the ZnO substrate by 0.53 eV. The conversion of COOH to CO and the desorption of CO are the PDS of the CO2RR on ZnO, Mn-, Fe-, and Co-, Ni-, Cu-TCSACs. Thus, CO becomes the key intermediate in the CO2RR over the TM-TCSACs. Spin- state analysis indicates that the IS state Fe atoms induce spin splitting of the C atom orbitals of the adsorbed CO and facilitates optimal coupling between C-px, py, and Fe-dx 2y 2, dz 2; between C-pz and Fe-d. This coupling results in a moderate bonding strength between TCSACs and CO, indicating that the TCSAC strongly activates CO. In addition, the Fe-TCSAC exhibits excellent performance for electro- catalytic CO2RR FECO of 91.6 at 0.9 V vs RHE. Moreover, the FECO and current density of Fe-TCSACs remain stable after 30 h of electrolysis at 0.9 V. The spin state of the Fe-TCSAC from experiments agrees well with the calculation results. This work provides a theoretical basis for studying the spin-state effect of tetrahedron-coordinated single-atom catalysts. Moreover, the research methodology reported herein provides valuable guidance for the rational design and optimization of high-performance electrocatalysts.

Here, we systematically investigate the electrochemical synthesis of hydroxylamine via a formaldehyde-mediated method on titanium oxides. An electrochromic rutile array prepared via a wet-chemical route achieved a Faradaic efficiency FE of 92.6 for formaldehyde oxime and a corresponding yield rate of up to 2085 μmol cm2 h1 under ambient conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal that the electrochromism is a macroscopic manifestation of the protonation of Ob bridging oxygen sites and the formation of Ov oxygen vacancies and Ti3, which act as proton sponges and electron reservoirs. Formaldehyde not only serves as the capturing agent but also helps to stabilize NH2OH through molecular tuning, thereby achieving high selectivity. Through formaldehyde-nitrate electro-reforming, hydrogen, formic acid, and hydroxylamine can be coproduced at 200 mA cm2 under an ultralow cell voltage of 0.78 V. This work links the catalytic performance of hydroxylamine electrosynthesis to the dynamic surface of titanium oxides, offering insights into selectivity control in nitrate electroreduction and providing a green, cost-effective alternative to conventional hydroxylamine synthesis. INTRODUCTION Nitrogen is a vital element for all life forms and plays a crucial role in industrial production and daily life.1,2 However, the industrial processes and artificial nitrogen conversions have elicited a persistent imbalance in the nitrogen cycle Figure 1a, resulting in the accumulation of harmful nitrates and nitrites in environment, thereby leading to a series of ecological crises.35 In recent years, the electroreduction of nitrate NO3 and nitrite NO2 , preferably powered by renewable energy, has emerged as a promising strategy to restore a balanced nitrogen cycle, garnering increasing attention.68 Electrochemical nitrate reduction NO3RR effectively removes nitrate pollutants from wastewater and converts it into valuable chemicals, facilitating the recycling of nitrogen resources9,10 Current research focuses primarily on two strategies Figure 1b: reducing NO3 into dinitrogen N2 for water purification11 and converting NO3 into ammonia NH3 for nitrogen fertilizer production.12 The main by- products in these processes are hydrogen and nitrite NO2 , with barely any other products reported. Hydroxylamine NH2OH is an important nitrogenous feedstock and is extensively used in synthesizing various nitrogen-containing compounds in the chemical, pharmaceut- ical and agrochemical industries.1315 Conventional hydroxyl- amine synthesis encompasses diverse routes Raschig, hydro- genations, often facing challenges like multistep processes, byproduct generation, or reliance on harsh conditions, motivating greener electrochemical approaches.1618 In contrast, the route of reducing nitrate into hydroxylamine NO3 to NH2OH using water as the proton source and powered by renewable energy could not only effectively remove the nitrate pollutants from wastewater but also provide a more sustainable avenue toward green production of hydroxylamine.

However, the NO3RR process follows a complex multielectron and multiproton transfer mechanism and NH2OH is usually formed as a reaction intermediate.1921 Its strong adsorption on catalyst surface, the high tendency of HONH2 bond to cleavage, and the instability of NH2OH pose significant challenges for achieving high-selectivity direct production via NO3RR.

Inspired by strategies using surface adsorbates to modulate catalytic activity, here we hypothesize that mediators like formaldehyde may play a role more than simply capturing the NH2OH intermediate, but also potentially tuning the reaction pathway via surface interactions. To explore this potential molecular tuning effect27,28 and to develop high-efficiency hydroxylamine synthesis systems, transition metal oxides with rich surface chemistry and tunable structures offer an attractive platform. In particular, titanium dioxide TiO2 has garnered extensive attention by virtue of its stability, cost-effectiveness, and the known role of surface defects like Ov oxygen vacancies in catalysis. Herein, we systematically investigate the formaldehyde- mediated electroreduction of nitrate on various TiO2 phases and facets, focusing on elucidating the interplay between the catalysts dynamic surface associated with its electrochrom- ism and the potential molecular modulating role of form- aldehyde. We developed a high-performance rutile array catalyst via a wet-chemical method, and identified Ti5cOb sites as the active centers facilitating an unconventional nitrate reduction pathway. This rutile array catalyst exhibited a remarkable Faradaic efficiency FE of 92.6 for the formaldehyde oxime product and achieved a yield rate up to 2085 μmol cm2 h1 under ambient conditions. The pronounced electrochromism of this catalyst reflects the dynamic formation of Ov and Ti3, which effectively activate NO3 . Combining in situ characterizations attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared ATR-FTIR, differ- ential electrochemical mass spectrometry DEMS and solid- state NMR ssNMR with density functional theory DFT calculations, we infer that formaldehyde not only acts as a capturing agent but also modifies the catalyst surface forming Ti5cOCH2Ob species, altering the reaction pathway and promoting hydroxylamine intermediate desorption Figure 1c. Finally, we demonstrate an energy-efficient electro- reforming system that coproduces hydrogen, formic acid, and the hydroxylamine precursor at 1 V cell voltage, highlighting its potential industrial viability through techno-economic analysis and device-scale tests.",

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Catalyst Screening and Performance Analysis.

A series of commercial TiO2 samples Figure S1 with different crystallo- graphic structures including rutile, anatase, and brookite, as well as P25 were tested. After 1 h electrolysis at 0.8 V vs RHE, the 1H NMR spectra for the electrolyte show distinct peaks corresponding to CH2NOH Figure S2. Notably, the commercial brookite sample exhibits the highest catalytic activity, achieving a FE of 36 Figure 2a. To systematically unravel the structureactivity relation- ships for formaldehyde-mediated nitrate reduction over titanium oxides, we investigated the influence of some key properties of the materials used, including surface coordination sites, defect density Ov, and charge transport characteristics. Our findings are summarized in Figure S3. We began by examining the role of surface sites dictated by crystal phases and exposed facets. Using hydrothermal synthesis, we prepared a series of TiO2 samples with well-defined shapes and specific exposed facets29 see details in Supporting Information, including B brookite, Figure S4 210, A anatase, Figure S5 001, A 101, A 111, and R rutile, Figure S6 110, 111, 331. These specific crystal facets were confirmed via X-ray diffraction XRD, Raman spectroscopy and trans- mission electron microscopy TEM Supplementary Notes 1, 2. Activity tests Figure 2a revealed a rather low performance for the anatase phases; in contrast, brookite B 210 showed a good activity FE 36, similar to commercial brookite. Notably, the rutile samples synthesized via wet-chemistry, such as R 110 and the high-index R 331, exhibited significantly higher activities than commercial rutile.

In addition to active sites and defects, an optimized electrocatalytic performance also requires efficient charge transport. To address the potential limitation in electrical conductivity for powder catalysts, we directly grew the rutile array on conductive carbon paper rutile arrayCC, Figure S9. This architecture, ensuring excellent catalyst support interface and inheriting the advantages of wet- chemically synthesized rutile predominantly exposing 110 facets with Ti5cOb sites and inherent Ov, displayed exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity. The rutile array displayed an exceptional FE of 92.6 and a production rate of 1521.5 μmol cm2 h1, indicating a superior catalytic selectivity and intrinsic activity. To evaluate the economic potential of this synthesis strategy for hydroxylamine NH2OH production, we conducted a techno-economic analysis TEA based on recently reported models23 Supplementary Note 6. With the electricity price presumed at 3 centskWh, using the rutile array or other high- selectivity and high-activity catalysts proves profitable Figure 2b. Furthermore, we believe that when the current density exceeds 200 mA cm2 with an efficiency greater than 90, the catalyst would meet the industrial demands of electrochemical production. With the catalytic activity further improved and renewable energy prices further decreased, the costs associated with this strategy would be lowered significantly, demonstrat- ing its promising application potential Figure S10.

The linear sweep voltammetry LSV curves Figure 2c indicate that the introduction of formaldehyde can suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction HER, as evidenced by a decline in current density, probably because of the competing adsorptions between formaldehyde and H. The current density measured in the nitrate-containing electrolyte was significantly higher than in the 1 M KOH electrolyte, demonstrating the pronounced electrocatalytic activity of the rutile array for nitrate reduction compared with background reactions such as HER under these conditions. The introduction of formaldehyde during the nitrate electro- reduction results in a slight decrease in current density. Over the applied potential range from 0.4 V to 1.0 V, CH2NOH emerges as the main reduction product Figure 2d, with NH3 as the major byproduct in electrolyte and N2O as the major byproduct in gas phase. The total selectivity for CH2NOH is greater than 80 Figure 2e, and the FE trend displays a volcano-like shape, yet with the production rate monotonically increasing. Under the reaction conditions, formaldehyde does not undergo electroreduction to methanol Figure S13, as NO3 would be preferentially reduced over HCHO.30,31 Moreover, the Cannizzaro reaction in alkaline environment within the reaction time frame did not significantly impact the results. Notably, at an applied potential of 0.8 V vs RHE, the FE for CH2NOH reaches 92.6, with an average current density approaching 262 mA cm2. At 1.0 V, the yield rate of CH2NOH over the rutile array is as high as 2085 μmol cm2 h1, standing as one of the highest yield rates reported thus far for NH2OH electrosynthesis Table S1. CH2NOH was not detected in the absence of KNO3 and HCHO, confirming that the carbon and nitrogen sources for CH2NOH do come from HCHO and KNO3 Table S2, respectively. High FEs for CH2NOH can be achieved over a relatively wide range of formaldehyde concentrations Figure S14. Furthermore, the rutile array exhibited an excellent catalytic durability, maintaining a FE of 85 and a yield rate of 1500 μmol cm2 h1 after 20 cycles under the same reaction conditions Figure 2f.

Mechanistic Investigations. It is worth noting that rutile array exhibits a prominent reversible electrochromism Figure 4a, which correlates with its catalytic activity. When the potential reached 0.3 V vs RHE, the catalyst started to turn blue electron and proton injection. The catalyst color in the potential ranges from 0.4 V to 0.9 V changed from light blue to dark blue, and the formaldehyde oxime yield increased rapidly. When the potential reached 1.0 V, numerous bubbles were observed on the catalyst surface Figure S19, indicating the occurrence of HER and the formation of N2O. During a complete cyclic voltametric scan, the catalyst turns blue as the potential goes negative and rapidly bleaches as the potential goes positive along with 0.25 V vs RHE oxidation peak.36 For a more detailed explanation on the reversibility of the entire process, please see Supplementary Note 4 Video S1 and Figures S20, S21. We then employed a variety of character- ization techniques to probe the actual active sites in rutile array Figure S22. For the TiO2 surface, the electrochromism is typically attributed to the light absorption due to free electrons at Ov and the dd transitions of Ti3 in JahnTeller distorted octahedra.37 By comparing the quasi-in situ XPS profiles Figure S23 for the original and colored states preserved and detected under argon atmosphere, it was noted that the binding energy of Ti 2p shifts to lower energy for the colored state. The binding energy decreases by 0.45 eV for the dark- blue sample in sole NO3 reduction and by 0.3 eV for the light-blue sample in NO3 HCHO cooperative reduction, suggesting that the electrochromism is primarily due to the reduction of TiO2 as it accepts electrons, forming Ti3 species.38 We hypothesize that as the potential goes negative, electrons in the catalyst attract protons in the electrolyte onto the surface to form ObH bonds, and simultaneously reduce Ti4 into Ti3. The ObH could further undergo elimination of H2O molecule, yielding Ov. When the material is subjected to a potential more positive than 0.3 V vs RHE or to an oxidizing atmosphere, the Ov would become occupied and the surface- adsorbed hydrogen species would undergo oxidation and desorption Figure S24.39 During the electroreduction of nitrate, the generation",

When the material is subjected to a potential more positive than 0.3 V vs RHE or to an oxidizing atmosphere, the Ov would become occupied and the surface- adsorbed hydrogen species would undergo oxidation and desorption Figure S24.39 During the electroreduction of nitrate, the generation of colored Ti3 species through electrochromism is facilitated by the formation of Ov and TiObH, along with hydrogen insertion. These surface-active species are closely associated with the nitrate reduction and the electrosynthesis of formaldehyde oxime. To probe the electronic structure and surface states of the catalyst under working conditions, we performed operando X- ray absorption spectroscopy XAS to investigate the ensemble average of the near-surface local Ti coordination environment in the Rutile Array samples Figure 4b, S25. Ti K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure XANES profile shows three pre-edge peaks characteristic of rutile at 4969.4, 4972.0, and 4975.1 eV, corresponding to dipole-allowed transitions in the distorted octahedra of rutile: the first peak stems from the quadrupolar transition of 1s 3d t2g, the second from the dipolar transition of 1s 3d t2g 4p hybridized states, and the third from the pure dipolar transitions of 1s 3d eg 4p hybridized states.40 As the potential gradually shifts cathodically, pre-edge peaks with higher intensities emerge, indicative of a broken symmetry, and a more distorted local structure. This implies that the density of Ov increases further at more cathodic potentials, or that the surface adsorbates disrupt the coordination symmetry of Ti, exacerbating the JahnTeller effect.41,42 Simultaneously, at more negative potentials 0.6 V to 0.8 V, the absorption edge shifts to lower energy, and the white line intensity diminishes, indicating a lowered oxidation state of Ti. Semiquantitative fitting reveals a valence state of 3.72 Figure S26. The Fourier transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure FT-EXAFS spectra shows three primary scattering paths Figure 4c: the major peak at 1.5 Å corresponds to the TiO path, the peak at 2.4 Å to TiTi scattering in the second shell, and the peak at 3.1 Å to TiOTi scattering in the third shell. The intensities of these peaks decrease in the order of 0 V, 0.2 V, and 0.8 V, which agrees well with the decrease in the coordination numbers CNs of O and Ti around the Ti center. The CNs of the TiO2 samples were determined through quantitative fitting of the FT-EXAFS curves Figure S27. When the potential goes from 0 V to 0.8 V, the CNs of TiO in the first shell decreases from 3.28 to 2.83, whereas the CNs of TiTi scattering path decreases from 1.23 to 0.97. This decrease in coordination, reflecting increased oxygen vacancy formation, coincides with the enhancement of cathodic current density and the development of macroscopic electrochromism in the catalyst Table S5. In addition, quasi- in situ XRD reveals a slight decrease in the lattice constant Figure S28, further confirming the increase in Ov during the electroreduction.

Therefore, the electrochromism is a macroscopic manifes- tation of low-valence-state, high-reducing-activity Ti3 species accompanied by Ov and hydrogen adsorption Hads at cathodic potentials. These active species play a crucial role in the activation process of nitrate reduction. The introduction of formaldehyde leads to competitive adsorption, which decreases the concentrations of Ov and Hads on the catalytic surface, resulting in a lighter color. Such a change would also lead to the formation of new active adsorbed species which will be discussed in detail below, thereby modulating the catalytic selectivity. Reaction Intermediates. In the process of electro- reduction from nitrate to ammonia, there may be over a dozen of reaction intermediates and surface-adsorbed species, including H, OH, NO2 , HNO3, NO, NOH, HNO, N, NH, NH2, NHOH, NH2O, NH2OH, N2O and NH3. To investigate the reaction pathway for the coreduction from HCHO and NO3 to formaldehyde oxime, DEMS was employed to detect reaction intermediates under different conditions Figure S29.43 The tests were conducted in an alkaline electrolyte containing KNO3 Figure 4d: 1 no DEMS signals were detected at open-circuit potential; 2 at 100 s, a potential of 0.8 V vs RHE was applied, and signals for mz 44, 30, and 17 were clearly identified, indicating the formation of N2O, NO and NH3; 3 at 420 s, formaldehyde was introduced, and the DEMS signal for NH3 rapidly diminished within 100 s, while the NO signal intensified further, and signals for HNO and NH2OH emerged, with the signal for NO2 mz 46 showing a first increasing and then decreasing trend. Yet the signal for N2O did not change. It is possible that there may exist other active sites that are not affected by formaldehyde. Furthermore, we explored the DEMS signals of intermediates Journal of the American Chemical Society pubs.acs.orgJACS Article https:doi.org10.1021jacs.5c03124 J. Am. Chem. Soc. XXXX, XXX, XXXXXX F in different electrolytes under various potentials using a pulsed potential sequence Figure S30. Before the potential reached 0.4 V, and the catalyst did not turn blue, no signals were detected. As the potential went from 0.5 V to 0.9 V, the signals for intermediates intensified, indicating the generation of more intermediates. Complementary experiments using 15N- labeled nitrate Figure S31 verified nitrate as the nitrogen source for the detected species. Furthermore, the key intermediate signals observed were consistent with those obtained in the nonlabeled DEMS experiments, validating the data set used for subsequent pathway analysis. Derived from these DEMS results, we propose the plausible reaction pathways for the NO3RR over rutile array Figure S32. Notably, during the nitrate reduction process, only trace amounts of HNO and NH2OH intermediates were detected.

In contrast, under coreduction conditions, the signals for HNO and NH2OH were significantly stronger, with CH2NOH mz 45 also directly detected. If HCHO acts merely as a capturing agent for NH2OH intermediates to form form- aldehyde oxime, NH2OH would be rapidly consumed,44 and the signal for HNO would not exhibit a significant increase. Therefore, HCHO here may not only function simply as a capturing agent, but most likely also acts as a molecular tuning agent27 influencing the thermodynamic stability of intermedi- ates and the reaction kinetics of nitrate reduction through competitive adsorption with Hads and Ti5c on the rutile surface. This hypothesis is also corroborated by examining the effect of HCHO concentration Figure S14. We observed that the FE for CH2NOH exhibits a saturation at higher concentrations, while the overall yield rate follows a volcano-like trend owing to decreasing current density. Such a nonlinear and saturation kinetics is characteristic of surface-adsorption-mediated pro- cesses, providing strong evidence against the simple solution- phase trapping mechanism and supporting the role of formaldehyde as a surface modulator. Since DEMS detects the intermediates extracted from the near-surface region, its ability to observe specific intermediates depends on their surface kinetics and adsorption strength. Intermediates with very short lifetimes may not reach detectable steady-state concentrations, while strongly adsorbed intermediates may not desorb readily enough to be sampled, hindering their detection. This suggests that the pure nitrate reduction process might proceed at such a rapid pace that HNO, NO2, and NH2OH are not able to accumulate. The characteristics of strong adsorption and easy dissociation for NH2OH on the TiO2 surface hinder the detection via DEMS. In contrast, after the addition of formaldehyde, the surface modulation induced by formaldehyde lowered the nitrate reduction reaction rate, rendering the intermediates more readily detectable and facilitating the desorption of NH2OH. This promotes the carbonnitrogen coupling process from either the electric double layer in solution or the catalyst surface. Kinetics studies via operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy EIS also suggest disparate mechanisms in different electrolyte Figure S33, Supplementary Note 5. ATRFTIR spectroscopy further validated these mecha- nisms by directly identifying the intermediates. Notably, ATRFTIR spectroscopy detects surface-adsorbed species on the catalyst, rather than the desorbed species as detected using DEMS. In the NO3 reduction reaction Figure 4g, the peaks at 2852 cm1 and 2926 cm1 correspond to the formation of NH2OH,25 whereas the peak at 1457 cm1 is attributed to the bending vibration of NH2 Figure 4e, most likely resulting from NH4 formation. The peak at 3743 cm1 may correspond to νTiOH Figures S34, S35, indicating the generation of surface hydroxylated structures.45 These peaks gradually intensified as the potential went cathodic. In the system with formaldehyde added Figure 4f, a distinct C NO peak was detected at 1698 cm1 in the more negative potential range, arising from the coupling product H2C NOH46 or HCHO.

Moreover, the peaks characteristic of hydroxylamine disappeared Figure 4h, indicating efficient coupling of formaldehyde with NH2OH or rapid desorption of NH2OH. In contrast to the spectrum recorded in sole NO3 reduction, the νTiOH peak is absent here, confirming that the addition of aldehyde indeed lowered the surface hydrogen coverage, which competes for adsorption with protons. An additional peak emerged at 1429 cm1, which can be attributed to bidentate titanium-coordinated formaldehyde Ti2 OCH2O Figure S36.47 This surface-adsorbed species has been confirmed to be one of the key intermediates in the removal of formaldehyde in TiO2 during thermocatalysis, as have been evidenced via in situ scanning tunneling microscopy, infrared spectroscopy.48,49 In addition, we also explored the surface adsorbed species of rutile using quasi-in situ ssNMR Figure 4i. Notably, the rutile array sample synthesized using tertbutyl titanate as the precursor exhibits a significant amount of alkoxy-terminated TiOCH23CH3 structures on its surface, as indicated by the presence of methyl and methylene groups at 1.2 and 3.7 ppm, respectively.40 The potential- dependent Raman spectra show a gradual decrease in the intensity for the CH bond around 27603000 cm1 as the potential went cathodic Figure S37. This suggests that the alkoxy structure could be easily removed during electro- catalysis, carrying away surface bridge oxygen atoms, thereby generating more surface Ov than for commercial rutile catalysts. This is also the reason why the sample synthesized using liquid-phase synthesis method exhibits superior perform- ance compared to commercial rutile. After the reaction, the alkoxy-terminated structure disappears from the rutile surface, and a peak corresponding to the key adsorbed species Ti2 OCH2O emerges at 4.4 ppm.50 By examining the C 1s difference spectrum from quasi-in situ XPS Figures 4j and S38, we noticed that the signals for CHx and CO bonds increase significantly after the reaction, alongside a smaller increase for CON species. This indicates the presence of a bridged OCH2O structure with single-bond characteristics on the surface.51 On the basis of the studies involving electrochemistry, in situ XAS, ATR-FTIR, and DEMS, through cross-validation and analysis Figure S39, we conclude that the electrochemical reduction coupling of NO3 and HCHO occurs on the rutile surface, as illustrated in Figure 4k. Further kinetic insights were obtained from Tafel analysis. The experimental Tafel slope for NO3RR on the rutile array was determined to be 119.7 mVdec without formaldehyde, compared to 123.8 mVdec with HCHO addition Figure S40. These values imply that the first electron transfer step in the overall reaction sequence might be the rate-determining step RDS corresponding to a theoretical slope of 120 mVdec for n 1 electron transfer involved in the RDS. Notably, this kinetic behavior aligns with the concurrent onset of significant nitrate reduction currents and electrochromism indicating OvTi3 formation at potentials around 0.4 V Figures 4a, 2c, points toward a mechanism where",

This hypothesis could help explain a key seemingly contradictory observation: our rutile array, while being relatively inert for the hydrogen evolution reaction HER and having a poor intrinsic conductivity, exhibits anomalously rapid kinetics for nitrate reduction once a sufficient cathodic potential is applied. Conventional NO3RR pathways often rely heavily on efficient surface hydrogen H generation via water dissociation, which is expected to be sluggish on the HER-inert TiO2. Furthermore, the initial reduction of the stable NO3 into NO2 is generally considered as the bottleneck in conventional mechanisms. However, the rapid kinetics observed here, coupled with the Tafel slope suggesting Figure 5.

We propose this alternative mechanism is mediated by dynamically generated Ov, with surface Ob sites potentially assisting protonation for Ov formation. For the nitrate reduction process after the rate-limiting Ov generation step, the high density of these Ov sites could facilitate the insertion of oxygen from NO3 . This disrupts the high symmetry of the nitrate ion, impairing the relatively inert NO bond and leading to ultrafast nitrate reduction kinetics, and thus the NO3 to NO2 step is no longer the RDS here. In DEMS, NO2 intermediates were not detected, further confirming that the reduction from NO3 to NO occurs with a high efficiency.

Additionally, H exists on the Ti surface bonded to Ob, allowing for a high mobility through the hydrogen bonding network, generating a self-sustained hydrogen spillover.52 Furthermore, H may also insert into the TiO2 lattice to form HTiO2 with lattice H, enabling reversible hydrogen storage, which collectively facilitates the on-demand supply of hydrogen.40 The vacancies and adsorbed species as electron donors introduce new energy levels, while the surplus 3d orbital electrons of Ti occupy the Ov, enhancing the metallic characteristics of TiO2x and improving the conductivity to promote electron transport. In the presence of formaldehyde, HCHO competes for adsorption with H, thereby influencing the concentrations of Ti3 and Ov. Under electrochemical reduction conditions in aqueous solution, chemically adsorbed HCHO predominantly exists in a stable Ti5cOCH2Ob form. Through spatial effects and electronic modulation, this process constrains the kinetics of nitrate reduction and stabilizes the NH2OH intermediate, enabling efficient electrosynthesis of the coupling product CH2NOH across a wide potential range. Theoretical Investigations via DFT Calculations. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of nitrate electroreduction on the rutile surface and the potential regulating role of formaldehyde in this process, we conducted spin-polarized density functional theory DFT calculations on all possible pathways for the overall reaction. As electron microscopy characterizations and geometric analysis have shown in Figure 3b, the 110 plane is the exposed facet. Thus, the rutile 110 surface with a symmetric structure of Ti5c and Ob was constructed as the active surface. Given the complexity of the nitrate electroreduction mechanism on the TiO2 surface, we calculated the most stable adsorption configurations of all intermediates on the rutile surface as illustrated in Figures S41, S42 and systematically studied the evolution pathways of the active species in NO3RR Tables S6, S7. To validate our hypothesis regarding the RDS derived from Tafel analysis, we calculated the energetics for Ov formation on both an ideal rutile 110 surface and an OBu n-butanol- terminated model surface. The results detailed in Figure S43 revealed that the RDS for Ov generation on the OBu- terminated surface is indeed the initial electron transfer protonation step Step 1 in our proposed scheme, with a barrier of 0.64 eV. This finding strongly supports our interpretation of the experimental Tafel slope 120 mV dec and confirms that active site formation probably governs the overall reaction kinetics in our system. With the understanding that Ov generation is the kinetic bottleneck, we then used DFT to investigate the subsequent reaction pathway initiated by the facile activation of nitrate on these Ov sites. We explored the interaction of NO3 with the Ov-containing surface Figure 5a.53 Compared with bidentate adsorption of NO3 on Ti5c 0.11 eV, the oxygen atom in NO3 could more readily occupy the Ov site for recovery 0.32 eV. In this process, the electrons previously stored at Ti3 could be released synchronously, resulting in an altered local charge density that activates",

In this process, the electrons previously stored at Ti3 could be released synchronously, resulting in an altered local charge density that activates the NO bond in the inserted NO3 , effectively cleaving NO3 to generate NO2 , while the recovered Ov now exists as OH. This step NO3 H NO2 OH is highly exothermic 1.95 eV, different from conventional mechanisms for nitrate electro- reduction where the activation of nitrate to nitrite occurs readily. This finding aligns well with the fact that NO2 intermediates could barely be detected in DEMS. Further, the NO2 adsorbed on Ti5c would rearrange into a bidentate adsorption ONOD configuration, followed by sequential H2O elimination to generate NO. This step has no significant thermodynamic barrier, featuring a gradual decrease in free energy. We then calculated the reaction pathway for reducing NO to NH3Figure 5b. NO would be preferentially reduced into NHO ΔG 0.05 eV rather than to NOH 0.445 eV. The conversion from NOH to N is even less favorable, thus establishing the basis for selective hydroxylamine production. Starting from NHO, NH3 could be produced via three pathways: 1 Protonation at the N end to form NH2OH, which then dissociates and undergoes H2O elimination to generate NH2. 2 Protonation at the N end to form NHOH, which undergoes H2O elimination to give NH, and then further protonated directly to NH2. 3 Protonation at the O end to form ONH2, which can either follow the NH2OH route via pathway 1 or proceed via the Langmuir Hinshelwood mechanism to directly yield ONH3 through a hydrogen atom transfer HAT process. For pathways 1 and 2, both reactions are exothermic and likely to occur, whereas pathway 3 ONH2 ONH3 has a small thermodynamic barrier ΔG 0.13 eV. To sum up, on the rutile 110 surface, nitrate electro- reduction is more likely to follow pathway 1 involving the key intermediate NH2OH. The selectivity between NH2OH and NH3 depends on the balance between the adsorption and dissociation of NH2OH. On pure rutile surfaces, NH2OH is more likely to dissociate 0.59 eV than to desorb 1.61 eV, making it rather difficult to detect NH2OH in DEMS, and therefore NH3 becomes the predominant detectable product. When formaldehyde is introduced, it adsorbs in the form of OCH2, generating the key adsorbate species Ti2OCH2O, which facilitates strong electron transfer at the TiO2 surface. Additionally, its adsorption site overlaps with the protonated Ob sites responsible for the electrochromism, leading to competitive adsorption, which explains the observed fading in electrochromism. The adsorbed HCHO significantly alters the electronic structure of the surface and affects the stability of various intermediates through intermolecular interactions. On the basis of these results, we calculated the energy landscape in the presence of the Ti2OCH2O species Figure 5c. Similar to the clean surface, the surface with formaldehyde is more likely to follow the NHO intermediate pathway, forming NHOH",

Remark- ably, the aldehyde intermediate stabilizes NH2OH, rendering it less likely to dissociate into NH2 OH, with a dissociation barrier of 1.27 eV.

This suggests that the key adsorbate species Ti2OCH2O, arising from competitive adsorption of aldehydes, effectively stabilizes the NH2OH intermediate, making it difficult to cleave, while allowing for easier desorption. This promotes the direct coupling with free HCHO, resulting in the formation of CH2NOH and significantly altering the product distribution to achieve a high selectivity for CH2NOH. Electro-reforming System. To achieve higher yields, enhanced energy efficiency, and lower the cost of electro- catalytic hydroxylamine production, we explored an electro- reforming route for hydroxylamine synthesis. Here form- aldehyde, in addition to being the molecular modulator and capturing agent for nitrate reduction as discussed above, also served as an energy carrier. Recently, copper-based materials have been shown to be a promising approach to achieve low- potential oxidation of aldehydes and through Tafel recombi- nation to produce hydrogen and formic acid under alkaline conditions,54 with a theoretical potential of only 0.22 V. Therefore, combining anodic FOR formaldehyde oxidation reaction with cathodic formaldehyde-mediated nitrate reduc- tion for hydroxylamine synthesis presents a thermodynamically more favorable strategy Figures 5d, S44, S45. This not only generates value-added anodic products such as H2 and HCOOH, but also significantly lowers the cell voltage input and maximizes the utilization of formaldehyde. We employed Cu3Ag7CF55 as the catalyst for aldehyde oxidation dehydro- genation and used rutile array as the catalyst for hydroxylamine synthesis Figure 5e. In comparison to the 2.3 V cell voltage required for the system with OER at the anode, our system with FOR at the anode only requires 0.78 V to achieve an industrial current density of 200 mA cm2 Figure 5f, while simultaneously producing hydroxylamine, formic acid, and hydrogen Figure S46. In the flow electrolyzer, the reaction system could operate stably at a current density of 200 mA cm2 for 10 h with almost no degradation in Faradaic efficiency for CH2NOH Figure S45c. Notably, the theoretical potential for nitrate-to-hydroxylamine conversion under alkaline con- ditions is 0.53 V vs RHE. By engineering electrocatalysts with lower overpotentials, the energy-consuming processes of nitrate electroreduction and formaldehyde electro-oxidation can be reconfigured into a formaldehyde-nitrate fuel cell that generates electrical energy, potentially achieving an open- circuit voltage",

This would significantly improve the economic feasibility of this technological approach Supplementary Notes 6, 7. With its superior energy conversion efficiency, we believe that our formaldehydenitrate coelectrolysis system holds great prom- ise for industrial-scale applications. SUMMARY In conclusion, we unveiled the reaction mechanism of nitrate electroreduction into hydroxylamine mediated by formalde- hyde on various phases and surfaces of TiO2, and identified Ti5cOb as the active center. The self-supported rutile array, predominantly exposing the 110 crystal facet, exhibits a remarkable catalytic activity, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 92.6 for CH2NOH and a yield of up to 2085 μmol cm2 h1. In addition, we found that the electrochromism of the catalyst is highly related to its catalytic activity. Specifically, this electrochromism manifests the dynamic generation of Ov and Ti3, the true active species that drive nitrate reduction via cycling processes involving Ob sites. Moreover, formaldehyde not only serves as a capturing agent but also as a molecular regulator, thereby enhancing the stability of the NH2OH intermediate and altering the reaction pathway to achieve selective reduction to give the target product. This work opens up a sustainable route to producing NH2OH under mild conditions through green electrochemistry and provides new insights into the selective regulation of nitrate reduction.

To achieve this goal, the direct hydrogen atom transfer HAT via radical pathway has become an attractive strategy. Taking the advantage of photoelectrochemistry, we herein describe oxidative Csp3H amination and etheriﬁcation reactions via a photoelectrochemical pathway, which could directly transform easily available hydrocarbons into N-heterocycle and ether products under mild conditions. Applying 9-phenylacridine as a direct hydrogen atom transfer d-HAT reagent under 390 nm LED light irradiation and electrolysis, the scope of our method includes not only simple alkanes, but also a wide range of Csp3H molecules including ethers, thioethers, silanes, and amides. The reaction shows broad scope 135 examples and uncon- ventional regioselectivity, with the occurrence of both Csp3H amination and etheriﬁcation preferentially at the sterically unhindered positions. Further- more, gram-scale experiments and relevant mechanistic investigations are carried out to illustrate the reaction mechanism. Hydrocarbons are fundamental raw materials in physical science. The development of synthetic methodologies for the functionalization of simple and unactivated hydrocarbons has the potential to explore uncharted chemical space and construct complex molecular scaffolds14. Moreover, by directly activating aliphatic CH bonds of hydrocarbons, chemists can bypass commonly used alkyl halides and organometallic reagents, and directly use the feedstock materials for late-stage derivatization of pharmaceutical molecules, natural pro- ducts, agrochemicals and functionalized materials58. However, the strong bond dissociation energies BDE: 96101 kcal.mol-1 of Csp3H bonds in alkanes, combined with their high redox potentials usually above 3.0 V vs. SCE, have hampered the direct use of unactivated alkanes in synthetic transformations9,10. In recent years, photo-induced radical-mediated hydrogen atom transfer HAT strategy has been greatly expanded into this area, as the efﬁcient conversion of visible light into chemical energy allows the direct functionalization of unactivated Csp3H bonds under thermodynamically unfavorable or kinetically inert conditions, overcoming the constraints of redox potentials under mild conditions11,12. Current hydrogen atom transfer methods that directly trap the generated carbon-centered radical intermediates include the use of diverse radical acceptors as well as transition-metal-catalyzed platforms, and a series of carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bond forming reactions have been success- fully achieved Fig. 1a, transition metal copper, iron, manganese, etc.1317. Among these developed protocols, Csp3H amination and etheriﬁcation stand out as unique transformations, as the incorpora- tion and manipulation of N-heterocycle, amine, and ether functional- ities on hydrocarbons would provide a plethora of opportunities for the preparation of simple building blocks and drug intermediates18.

On the other hand, Csp3H oxygenation reaction for the construction of ether products directly from simple alkanes has been rarely reported41,42. Therefore, explora- tion of catalysts and reagents that allow the selective functionalization of unactivated hydrocarbons under more practical and functional- group-tolerant conditions and with greater generality with respect to N- and O-coupling partners would be of great value. With this in mind, we questioned whether our recent Csp3H functionalization work43, combining HAT with a photoelectrochemical approach, would be suited to the development of a mild and general protocol for Csp3H amination and etheriﬁcation. The use of elec- trons in electrochemistry as a green and economical redox reagent can overcome the high oxidation potential of alkanes in a milder and more practical way4447. Simultaneous anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction reactions enable the transformation of a mild radical med- ium, eliminating the need for proton acceptor or stoichiometric oxi- dantreductant4853. In recent years, a series of photoelectrochemical strategies based on the advantages of photochemistry and electro- chemistry have been reported, which further enrich the chemical conversion approaches5457. The successful application of photoelec- trochemical reactions with reference value provides a practical path- way for the direct Csp3H functionalization of unactivated hydrocarbons58. In this work, we present an efﬁcient copper-catalyzed Csp3H amination and etheriﬁcation protocol mediated by a photoelec- trochemical hydrogen atom transfer process. Using easily available hydrocarbons as substrates, N-heterocycles and aromatic alcohols as coupling partners, this method enables the synthesis of the corre- sponding alkylated N-heterocycles and ethers in a single step Fig. 1b. Key features of this study include: 1 the absence of external oxidant species, the use of inexpensive and readily available copper catalysts, ligands, electrolytes, additives, and solvents, along with mild reaction conditions, straightforward operation, scalability, and efﬁcient performance in batch, highlighting the methods potential for industrial application; 2 a broad substrate scope, which has been expanded not only to diverse Csp3H hydrocarbons including simple alkanes, ethers, thioethers, silanes, amides, and aldehydes, but also to a series of N- and O-coupling partners; 3 most notably, the photoelectrochemical hydrogen atom transfer process is accomplished by the addition of 9-phenylacridine as a direct hydrogen atom transfer d-HAT reagent11,12. While the use of acridine salts as photocatalysts5964, electrophilic nitrogen-centered radicals e.g., quinuclidine, amine, sulfonamide, amide, and azide as d-HAT reagents has been widely reported65,66, HAT reactions involving acridine-based N-centered radicals as cheap and easily available d-HAT reagents have not been explored yet6770.

Detailed mechanistic studies are further conducted to elucidate the reaction mechanism. Results Optimization studies To explore the feasibility of the assembly of Csp3N bond on unac- tivated hydrocarbons, our studies were initiated by optimizing reac- tion conditions for the reaction of 3-bromo-1H-indazole 1 and cyclohexane 2, as shown in Table 1. The photoelectrocatalytic Csp3H amination reaction was conducted in an undivided cell 10 mL oven-dried quartz tube equipped with a graphite rod anode and a platinum plate cathode. Upon electrolysis and 390 nm light irradiation, 9-phenylacridine was utilized as an efﬁcient HAT catalyst under N2 atmosphere. After an extensive evaluation of the reaction conditions, the corresponding aminated product 3 was afforded in 73 yield Table 1, entry 1, employing CuCl2 as catalyst, L1 3,4,7,8- tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline as supporting ligand, Cs2CO3 as base, nBu4NBF4 as electrolyte in a mixed solvent of MeCNDCM 2:1, vv under constant-current electrolysis at 3.0 mA for 6 h at room Fig. 1 Prior art in radical-mediated Csp3H functionalization and an overview of this work. a Radical-mediated Csp3H functionalization via hydrogen atom transfer. b Photoelectrochemical copper-catalyzed CH amination and etheriﬁcation this work.

Supporting ligand plays a crucial role in the reaction, as the use of L1 gave the best yield, whereas substituting L1 with ligand L2 4,7-diphenyl-1,1-phenanthroline or L3 4,4-dimethoxy- 2,2-bipyridine resulted in a substantial decrease in efﬁciency entries 3-4. The experimental results showed that the replacement of nBu4NBF4 with nBu4NPF6 as electrolyte is unfavorable to the reaction entry 5, and only a moderate yield was afforded using BTMG 2-tert- butyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine as base entry 6. Moreover, the use of other solvents was explored but provided no improvement over mixed MeCNDCM, and replacing the platinum plate cathode with a graphite rod cathode led to lower reaction efﬁciency entries 78. In addition, the wavelength of the LEDs light source was also explored, but provided no improvement over 390 nm entry 9. The use of Eosin Y or TBADT tetrabutylammonium decatungstate instead of 9-phenylacridine led to no reaction efﬁciency entry 10. Control experiments indicated that electric current, catalysts, base and light irradiation are all essential, as the corresponding reactions performed without them resulted in poor or no reaction entries 11-13. Further investigations revealed that the reaction was performed under air atmosphere with lower yield of the desired product entry 14, indicating that the desired Csp3H amination product can be formed in the presence of oxygen, with loss of reaction efﬁciency.

Exploration of Substrate Scope With the optimized reaction conditions in hand, we began to investi- gate the scope of N-heterocycles for this photoelectrochemical Csp3H amination reaction. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the N-alkylation reaction of indazoles with cyclohexane 2 was successfully demon- strated, yielding the corresponding products 312 in moderate to good yields. A range of indazole substrates bearing halide 3-4, 10-12, aldehyde 5, nitrile 6, ester 7, ketone 8 and methyl moieties 9 proceeded well under the standard conditions.It is noteworthy that the photoelectrochemical reaction can be extended to substituted pyrazole 1318, indole 1923, pyrrole 2425, carbazole 2627, triazole 2829, imidazole 30 and phthalazone 31, producing the corre- sponding amine products in moderate yields.

The substrate scope was then expanded to substituted anilines 32, aminopyridines 3337, aminopyrimidine 38, and triazinamine 39, delivering the corresponding Csp3H amination products in moderate yields.

Furthermore, the reaction demonstrated that N-heterocycles such as oxindole 52, isatin 53, phthalimide 54, benzimidazolone 55 and cyclic carbamate 56 were tolerated as well. Moreover, we examined the late-stage modiﬁcation of several bioactive pharmaceu- tical agents to investigate the utility of this photoelectrochemical Csp3H amination method. Theophylline, which is a commonly used alkaloid for angina treatment, was tolerated under the standard con- ditions to give Csp3H aminated product 57 in 36 yield. Furthermore, our photoelectrochemical method facilitated the direct installation of alkyl groups on the N-heterocyclic drug molecules such as irbesartan, baritinib, and olaparib, yielding the desired N-alkylated products 59 to 61 in moderate yields, thereby providing opportunities for the selective modiﬁcation of structurally complicated pharmaceuticals. The oxazo- lidinone ring in muscle-relaxant drugs such as metaxalone underwent successful Csp3H amination with cyclohexane, producing products 62 in moderate yields. Finally, a large-scale experiment of cyclohexane 2 and 3-bromo-1H-indazole 1 on a 6 mmol scale was performed in order to evaluate the practical uses of this method, which could afford 3 in 60 yield 1.00 g, see the SI for more details. Next, we explore the scope of Csp3H bond-containing hydrocarbons with 3-bromo-1H-indazole 1 under the optimal pho- toelectrochemical conditions Fig. 2. In addition to cyclohexane, other cycloalkanes bearing various ring sizes, including cyclopentane 63, cyclooctane 64 and cyclododecane 65, are all found to be viable Csp3H substrates, which were smoothly converted into the corresponding Csp3H aminated products in 45-60 yields.

Adamantane bearing a rigid cage structure also exhibited interesting regioselective character- istics, with the secondary Csp3H bond of adamantane pre- ferentially aminated 67, 55:45 regioselectivity of 2:3 C H bonds.

These site-selective characteristics are unlike other previously reported Csp3H functionalization reactions, in which the HAT process usually occurred at the 3 Csp3H bond64,71. Several acyclic alkanes were further investigated and were found to be well com- patible under the standard reaction conditions, furnishing the desired amine products 6870 in moderate yields. Csp3H amina- tion of n-hexane gave a mixture in a combined yield of 48 68. The reaction favored the methylene groups over the distal methyl group, the site selectivity of which matched our previously reported Csp3H thiolation reaction via a photo-induced Fe-LMCT process72. Interestingly, the reaction of 2,3-dimethylbutane 69 exclusively occurred at the distal methyl position rather than weaker and steri- cally hindered 3 Csp3H bonds, which indicates that steric hin- drance also plays a key role in affecting the regioselectivity of CH amination. Upon using 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene as a substrate, the Csp3H amination exclusively took place at the terminal isopropyl group 71, while the sterically hindered benzylic 3 CH bond was not observed. The CH amination of 1,3,5-tri-tert-butylbenzene 72 with complete regioselectivity for the methyl groups. Furthermore, our method allowed the Csp3H amination to occur preferentially at the α-methylene of cyclic ethers, with the generation of the desired products 7375 in moderate yields. Similar to these exam- ples, the Csp3H amination reaction of acyclic ethers exclusively occurred at the weak and unhindered α-oxy Csp3H position, delivering the desired aminated products 7679 in acceptable yields and complete site selectivity. Notably, a recent report by Noël and co-workers describes an accelerated photoelectrocatalytic Csp3H amination reaction enabled by continuous-ﬂow synthesis, using compounds containing weak and secondary Csp3H bonds e.g., α-oxy, α-amino, and benzylic positions as viable substrates19. Our method, however, demonstrates the capability to react not only with hydrocarbons containing stronger Csp3H bonds but also with ether compounds containing both primary and secondary α-oxy Csp3H bonds. In addition, phenyl sulﬁde also proved to be an effective substrate, giving the N-alkylated product 80 in 38 yield at the position adjacent to a sulfur atom. Photoelectrochemical Csp3H amination of various silanes was also investigated, with the observation of Csp3H amina- tion products at the distal methyl groups 8182. Notably, the reaction of tetraethylsilane 83 revealed that the steric effect still dominated the site selectivity, preferentially giving the distal methyl aminated product. Finally, amide compounds proved to be viable substrates. The Csp3H amination reaction of dimethylacetamide with 3-bromo-1H-indazole 1 successfully gave 84 in 61 yield with complete site selectivity for the weak and active α-amino position rather than the CH site adjacent to the carbonyl group. Compared to the substrate scope of peroxide-based Csp3H amination reactions32,34, our method demonstrates a sub- stantially broader substrate range, allowing for the successful amination of hydrocarbons with aniline and aminopyridine compounds. Our method is not only applicable to the amination of simple alkanes, but can also be applied to various small organic molecules containing carbon-hydrogen",

Our method is not only applicable to the amination of simple alkanes, but can also be applied to various small organic molecules containing carbon-hydrogen bonds, including alkylated arenes, ethers, thioethers, silanes, and amides. After exploring the substrate scope of Csp3H amination reac- tion, we next hypothesize that the photoelectrocatalytic strategy would provide a universal platform for the Csp3H oxygenation reaction of unactivated hydrocarbons with alcohols, thus converting these readily available substrates into valuable ether products. After a series of condition optimizations see the SI for more details, the use of 9-phenylacridine and CuOTf2 benzene complex as co-catalyst, 4,7- diphenyl-1,1-phenanthroline L2 as supporting ligand, K2CO3 as base, nBu4NPF6 as electrolyte in a mixed solvent of MeCNDCE 1:1, vv upon photoirradiation and electrolysis could signiﬁcantly promote the Csp3H oxygenation reaction and obtain the target aryl ether pro- ducts. Under this optimal condition, we further extend the metho- dology to alcohol substrates to explore the substrate scope, as shown in Fig. 3. Expectedly, a myriad of phenols containing electron-donat- ingneutral 8590, 102103 and electron-withdrawing 91101 substituents were both successfully coupled with cyclohexane to give the corresponding aryl ether products in moderate to good yields. Notably, aryl halides 9193 groups were tolerated well in this C O cross-coupling reaction. Other important functional groups such as triﬂuoromethyl 94, sulfonyl 95, cyano 96, alkynyl 97, ketone 9899, and ester 100 were all compatible under the photoelec- trochemical conditions. A key intermediate in the production and modiﬁcation of lipid-lowering drug fenoﬁbrate can also react 98. Notably, both aryl boronate ester 101 and amide 102103 moieties were also tolerated. This method can be well applied to polycyclic aromatic ring 104. It was notable to see that hydroxy-substituted heterocycles containing benzooxazole 105, isobenzofuranone 106, dihydrobenzofuran 107, and dihydroquinolinone 108, a crucial intermediate in the synthesis of the antipsychotic medication aripi- prazole moieties were also compatible to afford the corresponding aromatic ether products 105108 in moderate yields. Furthermore, the current Csp3O cross-coupling method was applied to the late- stage etheriﬁcation of natural products and molecular drugs. Natural phenolic compounds such as raspberry ketone 109 and estrone 110, as well as pharmaceutically relevant substances such as L-tyr- osine derivatives 111 and ezetimide 112, underwent the photoelec- trochemical reactions with cyclohexane to gain the corresponding aryl ether products in moderate yields. Alkanols and carboxylic acids were also tested under the standard conditions for C O bond construction, but the reactions did not provide any positive results. In addition to C O bond formation, the scope of other nucleophiles for the Article https:doi.org10.1038s41467-025-60429-6 Nature Communications 2025 16:5123 5 construction of Csp3P, Csp3Se and Csp3S bonds was subse- quently explored.

The success of all the above-mentioned substrates, many of which contain sensitive alkyne, carbonyl, halide or heterocyclic groups, underscores the high che- moselectivity and functional group compatibility of our developed method. Next, the scope of C H bond-containing hydrocarbons for Csp3O bond formation was assessed. As shown in Fig. 3, various cycloalkanes were all found to be suitable Csp3H substrates Fig. 3 Substrate scope of Csp3H oxygenation.

Norbornane, as a viable substrate, could readily react with 4-phenylphenol to give the corresponding product 122 in 36 yield. Our method also showed the successful validation of Csp3H oxygenation of adamantane 123, with the occurrence of HAT process at the tertiary C H bond. Moreover, the Csp3O coupling of n-pentane 124 was found to effectively afford a mixture of ether products in a combined yield of 48, and the reaction favored the methylene groups over the distal methyl group. Similar to Csp3H amination protocol, our method allowed the Csp3H oxy- genation reaction to occur preferentially at the α-oxy position of cyclic and acyclic ethers 125130, indicating that the reaction favors the Csp3H functionalization of weak and sterically unhindered Csp3H bonds. Thioanisole proceeded well under the standard conditions 131. Notably, the Csp3O coupling of tetraethylsilane 132 revealed that the steric effect still dominated the site selectivity, preferentially giving the distal methyl Csp3O coupling product. The reaction of 4- methyl-1-pentene was also feasible 133, with the occurrence of Csp3H oxygenation exclusively at the weak allylic position. 2,3- Dimethyl-2-butene was demonstrated to be compatible with the method, furnishing the desired Csp3O coupling product 134 in 66 yield. It is noteworthy that the Csp3O coupling of aldehyde substrate 135136 delivered the corresponding ester products in moderate yields with complete site-selectivity at the CacylH bond.

Further- more, the reaction of dimethylacetamide with 4-phenylphenolatthe α- amino position was also exclusively observed 137. Mechanistic studies In order to get a deeper insight into the reaction mechanism, several mechanistic experiments were then carried out, as shown in Fig. 4. Firstly, the model reactions of Csp3H amination and etheriﬁcation were both strongly suppressed by a radical trapping experiment using 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl TEMPO as the radical scavenger Fig. 4a. The formation of the corresponding adduct 1-cyclohex- yloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 139 between TEMPO and cyclo- hexyl radical was observed and isolated see the SI for more details, with no detection of the expected Csp3H amination and etheriﬁca- tion products 3 and 85. Both of these results indicated that a radical pathway and key alkyl radical species might be involved in these two photoelectrochemical transformations. In order to further capture the key radical intermediates, an electron paramagnetic resonance EPR experiment was performed with the addition of a free radical spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide DMPO, as shown in Fig. 4b. The EPR spectroscopy studies revealed that a carbon-centered radical species were generated from the corresponding alkane substrate via an intermolecular HAT process and rapidly captured by DMPO to form relatively stable free radicals g 2.0074, AN 14.62 G, AH 21.54 G7376. To gain more insights into the hydrogen atom transfer HAT species, several control experiments were conducted in the absence of N-heterocycles or alcohols, as shown in Fig. 4c. Considering nitrogen radicals are prone to undergoing the HAT process65,66, the photoelec- trochemical reaction of 9-phenylacridine with cyclohexane 2 was then conducted in the absence of copper catalyst and supporting ligand, and yielded compound 141 in 16 yield as the major product. Notably, the yield of 141 was increased to 53 without constant cur- rent. This result indicated that the HAT species in this reaction is highly likely to be the nitrogen radical species formed by photoexcitation of 9-phenylacridine for the UV-Vis spectrum, see the SI for more details. The nitrogen radical extracted hydrogen from the alkane substrate to generate a transient alkyl radical 143 and a persistent triarylmethyl trityl radical 142, which would further undergo radical-radical coupling to release the ﬁnal product 141. Similar results were afforded with the utilization of mesitylene 144 or 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene 146 as the hydrocarbon substrate instead of cyclohexane, and the reactions successfully delivered the corresponding radical addition products 145 and 147 in 50 and 45 yields, respectively. Support for this mechanism was also provided by the formation of isotopically labeled product 141-D in 56 yield upon photo-induced reaction of 9-phenylacridine with deuterated cyclohexane 2-d12. The lower NH deuterium incorporation 12 D obtained in the product 141-D may be due to fast deuterium-proton exchange. Kinetic isotope effect KIE experiments were subsequently performed to explore whether the HAT step was the rate-determining step of the overall reaction process, as shown in Fig. 4d.

Kinetic isotope effect KIE experiments were subsequently performed to explore whether the HAT step was the rate-determining step of the overall reaction process, as shown in Fig. 4d. The photoelectrochemical reaction of 3-bromo-1H- indazole 1 with equal amounts of cyclohexane 2 and deuterated cyclohexane 2-d12 for 3 h under the standard conditions produced a mixture of CH amination products 3 and isotopically labeled 3-d11 in 32 yield. The obtained ratio kHkD 2.1 suggests that the HAT pro- cess is a turnover-limiting step in the overall reaction. A similar ratio kHkD 1.8 was obtained for the KIE of Csp3H etheriﬁcation under optimal reaction conditions, suggesting that the hydrogendeuterium atom extraction step may also be turnover-limiting. Having demonstrated the key intermediates in the reaction pro- cess, we next set out to investigate the origin of the site selectivity produced in the Csp3H functionalization reaction. As shown in Fig. 4e, we utilized 2,3-dimethylbutane DMB, 148 as a standard sub- strate to probe the site selectivity74,77,78. The control reaction showed that the addition of phenyl acrylate 149 to the standard photoelec- trochemical system containing DMB and 3-bromo-1H-indazole 1 successfully afforded Csp3H alkylation product 150 in 37 yield, with the alkylation preferentially occurring at 3 CH bond intrinsic selectivity of 13 is 1:13, which was calculated by the number of available Csp3H bonds. Electrolysis and photoirradiation of the same starting materials in the presence of 9-phenylacridine without copper also afforded the Csp3H alkylated product 150 in 42 yield. The above results conﬁrm the reversible HAT process for the forma- tion of carbon-centered radicals and imply that the use of radical acceptors largely inﬂuences the site selectivity43,72. To further prove the effectiveness of 9-phenylacridine as a d-HAT reagent, a series of radical-mediated Csp3H functionalization reac- tions of hydrocarbons were conducted under photo-induced reaction conditions Fig. 4f. The use of alkynyl sulfone 151 as an efﬁcient radical acceptor could successfully deliver the corresponding Csp3H alkynylation product 152 in 70 yield. Although the use of diphenyl disulﬁde 153 showed less efﬁciency for Csp3H thiolation, the desired Csp3H selenylation reaction could proceed very well to give the alkyl selenide product 114 in 73 yield. Furthermore, a divided-cell experiment was carried out Fig. 4g, with the placement of substrates 1 and 2 along with 9-phenylacridine, CuCl2, L1, Cs2CO3, nBu4NBF4 and solvent in the anode chamber, while nBu4NBF4 and solvent were added into the cathode chamber. As expected, the desired Csp3H amination product 3 was detected in the anode chamber with 40 yield, which suggested that the photoelec- trochemical Csp3H amination occurred mainly around the graphite rod anode. Similarly, the formation of the desired product 85 was observed in the anode chamber under the standard conditions of Csp3H etheriﬁcation, revealing that the photoelectrochemical Csp3H etheriﬁcation also took place mainly around the graphite rod anode rather than around the platinum plate cathode.

Taking the Csp3H amination reaction as an example, which is outlined in Fig. 5, we postulated that the reaction is initiated from the excitation of the acridine-based photocatalyst A to generate the excited species B. Then, the excited species B undergoes a hydrogen atom transfer HAT process with unactivated hydrocarbons to release a key carbon- centered radical intermediate D, while generating a persistent triar- ylmethyl trityl radical 1428082. Subsequently, intermediate 142 is Article https:doi.org10.1038s41467-025-60429-6 Nature Communications 2025 16:5123 7 electrochemically oxidized to triarylmethyl cation at the anode sur- face, followed by an elimination process to regenerate the 9-phenylacridine photocatalyst. On the other hand, the released carbon-centered radical D reacts with the copper complex H to gen- erate a CuIII species I, which undergoes reductive elimination to produce the Csp3H amination product J. Furthermore, the Fig. 4 Mechanistic studies. a Capture of alkyl radical by TEMPO, b Electron paramagnetic resonance EPR experiment, c Capture of trityl radical, d Kinetic isotopic effect KIE experiment, e Investigation of the site selectivity, f Photo- induced Csp3H alkynylation, thiolation and selenylation reactions enabled by 9-phenylacridine as d-HAT photocatalyst, g Divided-cell experiment.

Discussion In summary, we have developed a mild and efﬁcient Csp3H func- tionalization method enabled by a photoelectrochemical strategy. Using 9-phenylacridine as a direct hydrogen atom transfer d-HAT reagent under 390 nm LED light irradiation and electrolysis, this syn- thetic approach is capable of preparing various types of aliphatic N-heterocycle and ether compounds from hydrocarbons. Our meth- odology greatly extends the range of available substrates not only for N-heterocycles and phenol derivatives, but also for a wide variety of Csp3H compounds, including unactivated alkanes, ethers, thioe- thers, silanes, and amides. The mild reaction conditions, operational simplicity, remarkably broad substrate scope 135 examples, as well as scalability, demonstrate that the method has potential for industrial application. Importantly, the reaction exhibits unconventional site selectivity, with the occurrence of both Csp3H amination and etheriﬁcation preferentially at the sterically unhindered position. Considering the importance and versatility of N-heterocycle, amine, amide, and ether compounds as important functional molecules in organic synthesis, we believe that the method we have developed has the potential to be a versatile tool for chemists, offering a plethora of opportunities for selective installation of valuable functional groups at the late stage. Further development of other types of photo-induced and electrochemical reactions is still underway in our lab.

Atomically dispersed Cu catalysts have attracted significant attention due to their cost-effectiveness and catalytic potential. However, the inherently weak hydrogen dissociation ability of Cu results in low catalytic activity, necessitating elevated reaction temperatures, which limit its practical applicability. To overcome this limitation, we design a Ru single-atom-decorated, fully exposed Cu cluster catalyst Ru1CunSiO2 that exhibits outstanding performance in semihydrogenation of acetylene, achieving 100 acetylene conversion with 98 ethylene selectivity at 170 C. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy HAADF-STEM, X-ray absorption spectroscopy XAS, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS confirm the atomic dispersion of Ru and the structural evolution of Cu clusters. H2D2 exchange and temperature-programmed desorption TPD experiments reveal that Ru modification significantly enhances the hydrogen dissociation ability of the catalyst while tuning acetylene adsorption. Density functional theory DFT calculations further demonstrate that the Ru single atoms and Cu nanoclusters create a synergistic catalytic interface that markedly promotes hydrogen activation and lowers the energy barrier of the rate-determining step. This study provides fundamental insights into the rational design of atomically dispersed bimetallic catalysts and offers a new strategy for the efficient and selective acetylene hydrogenation. INTRODUCTION The semihydrogenation of acetylene is a critical catalytic reaction in the ethylene industry, as even trace amounts of acetylene 0.20.5 vol in the feedstock can poison the ZieglerNatta catalyst used in downstream polymerization.1,2 Therefore, the development of highly efficient catalysts for acetylene semihydrogenation is essential to ensure the selective conversion of acetylene to ethylene while minimizing over- hydrogenation to undesired ethane. Palladium Pd is one of the most active metals for this reaction.3 However, supported Pd nanoparticles NPs often result in poor ethylene selectivity. Achieving an optimal balance between the catalytic activity and ethylene selectivity in Pd NPs remains a significant challenge. To address this, various strategies, such as metal alloying,46 interface modification,7 and coordination environ- ment regulation,810 have been explored to improve the ethylene selectivity of Pd NPs. Despite extensive research on optimizing Pd-based catalysts, their high cost and scarcity necessitate the development of alternative, cost-effective catalytic systems. As a result, Cu- based catalysts have emerged as promising alternatives due to their cost-effectiveness and superior ability to suppress overhydrogenation,1116 thereby enhancing olefin selectiv- ity.1720 Atomically dispersed Cu catalysts, in particular, have demonstrated remarkable ethylene selectivity and stability, in stark contrast to the rapid deactivation observed in Cu nanoparticle catalysts.2125 However, suffering from the inherently weak hydrogen dissociation ability of Cu, Cu- based catalysts exhibit low catalytic activity and typically require high reaction temperatures above 200 C, limiting the potential to scale up",

To overcome this limitation, recent studies have focused on atomically dispersed bimetallic catalysts, such as CuZnNC2,26 Ni1Cu2g-C3N4,27 and Pd1Cu1NDG,28 which leverage the synergistic effect of incorporating a secondary metal to modulate the electronic structure and surface properties.

Moreover, the construction of decoupled active sites mitigates competitive adsorption effects, optimizing selectivity and activity in acetylene hydrogenation.29 Inspired by these, in this study, we report a SiO2-supported atomically dispersed bimetallic catalyst including Ru single atoms and fully exposed Cu clusters Ru1CunSiO2. More- over, Ru1CunSiO2 exhibits high catalytic activity while maintaining exceptional ethylene selectivity during complete acetylene conversion. Through a combination of electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and theoretical modeling, we identify the active site as a Ru single atom coordinated with a Cu3 cluster. Density functional theory DFT calculations reveal that the introduction of trace Ru atoms significantly enhances the hydrogen dissociation ability of the Ru1Cu3 cluster compared to Cu3 alone. Hydrogen molecules preferentially dissociate on Ru single atoms and then react with acetylene adsorbed on Cu clusters. Furthermore, the energy barrier for the rate-determining step CHCH2 C2H4 is substantially lowered on the Ru1Cu3 cluster, facilitating ethylene generation. These findings highlight the crucial role of RuCu synergy in optimizing catalytic performance, providing valuable insights for the design of novel, highly efficient, and ultrastable atomically dispersed metal catalysts.

The metal loadings of the catalysts were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry ICP-AES Table S1. Transmission electron microscopy TEM image of the nanosilica support reveals an average diameter of 15 nm Figure S1. Comprehensive character- ization of the Ru1CunSiO2 catalyst was performed to understand its structure. X-ray diffraction XRD analysis Figure S2 of catalysts exclusively displays characteristic SiO2 diffraction peaks, with no detectable peaks corresponding to metallic Ru or Cu, indicating the absence of crystalline Ru or Cu nanoparticles in Ru1CunSiO2. The structure of Ru1Cun SiO2 was investigated by High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy HAADF-STEM Figures 1 and S3. HAADF-STEM image Figure 1a reveals uniform dispersion of small clusters on the SiO2 support, with a magnified view confirming their amorphous structure inset. The HAADF-STEM images and the intensity profiles in Figure S3 further support a single-atom-layer configuration of the fully exposed clusters. The corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray EDX elemental mapping results show that Ru species are highly dispersed on the surface of SiO2, while Cu species are in the form of subnano-Cu clusters Figure 1b. Moreover, we marked the Cu cluster area at the same position on Ru mapping in Figure 1b. Notably, there are Ru atoms distributed close to the Cu cluster within the area as marked in the figure the dashed white circles. Thus, the EDX results corroborate the coexistence of atomically dispersed Ru atoms and fully exposed Cu clusters on the catalyst surface. To investigate the coordination and electronic structures of the catalysts, X-ray absorption spectroscopy XAS Figure 2 and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS measurements were performed. The Ru K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure XANES spectra of Ru1SiO2 and Ru1CunSiO2 indicate that the Ru atoms are in an oxidized state Figure 2a. Additionally, fitting results of extended X-ray absorption fine structure EXAFS Figure S4 and Table S2 support the atomic dispersion of the Ru species through the absence of a RuRu path and similar RuO paths in both Ru1SiO2 and Ru1CunSiO2.

Notably, Ru1Cun SiO2 reveals a CuCu path with an average coordination number C.N. of 3.2 0.8, whereas no CuCu coordination is observed in Cu1SiO2 Figure S5 and Table S3. These findings indicate the formation of Cu clusters in Ru1CunSiO2, in contrast to the Cu single atoms in Cu1SiO2. The above results demonstrate the existence of Ru single atoms and fully exposed Cu clusters in the Ru1CunSiO2 catalysts. Despite both catalysts being treated under the same reduction conditions, the Cu species in Ru1CunSiO2 were reduced more deeply than those in Cu1SiO2. The structural evolution to Cu clusters in Ru1CunSiO2 suggests that the introduction of Ru single atoms promotes the reduction of Cu species to clusters in Ru1CunSiO2 without requiring high reduction temperatures. Therefore, the CunSiO2 catalyst reduced to 500 C, with metallic Cu clusters as the active sites, was synthesized for comparison. Notably, this high- temperature-reduced monometal sample provides an impor- tant reference for highlighting the unique structural regulatory role of Ru in this bimetallic system. XAS measurements confirm the Cu cluster structure in CunSiO2 Figure S6. The EXAFS curve fitting data at the Cu K-edge Table S4 shows a CuCu coordination number of 3.6 1.0, which is similar to that in Ru1CunSiO2 C.N. 3.2 0.8. This indicates that the introduction of Ru reduces the reduction temperature required for Cu species to form clusters while avoiding possible metal aggregation under high-temperature reduction condi- tions, which emphasizes the critical role of Ru atoms in regulating the Cu structure in the Ru1CunSiO2 catalyst. XPS measurements were conducted after in situ reduction Figure S7. The Cu 2p XPS peak observed at 932.3 eV in Ru1CunSiO2 can be attributed to Cu0 or Cu species, suggesting the formation of metallic Cu clusters during the reduction process. The first-derivative XANES spectra further reveal the distinct Cu valence states between the Ru1CunSiO2 and CunSiO2 catalysts Figure S8. The Cu species in Ru1CunSiO2 exhibit a Cuδ 0 δ 1 state close to the Cu valence state. In contrast, the high-temperature reduction process employed for CunSiO2 leads to the formation of large Cu clusters, wherein the Cu species in CunSiO2 display a lower valence state than that in Ru1CunSiO2, due to the contribution of increased Cu0 species. These results reveal that Ru1CunSiO2 preserves a higher proportion of Cu species compared to CunSiO2. Therefore, we propose that Ru1CunSiO2 possesses a unique dual-site structure consisting of Ru single atoms and fully exposed Cu clusters, whereas fully exposed Cu clusters are",

Therefore, we propose that Ru1CunSiO2 possesses a unique dual-site structure consisting of Ru single atoms and fully exposed Cu clusters, whereas fully exposed Cu clusters are expected to optimize the reactant adsorption due to their abundant sites,30 with Ru single atoms showing potential to optimize hydrogen activation.31,32 Catalytic Performance. To elucidate the role of Ru single atoms and Cu clusters in Ru1CunSiO2, we evaluated the catalytic performance of Ru1CunSiO2, CunSiO2, Cu1SiO2, and Ru1SiO2 for acetylene hydrogenation. The reactions were carried out using a gas mixture of C2H2H2C2H4 1:10:20. Figure 3a presents the acetylene conversion and ethylene selectivity as functions of reaction temperature for different catalysts. The Ru1CunSiO2 catalyst achieved complete acetylene conversion at 170 C with an ethylene selectivity of 97.6, outperforming other catalysts. In contrast, the conversion of CunSiO2 reached only 74 at 200 C, while Cu1SiO2 exhibited a conversion of a mere 13 under the same conditions. These results confirm that Cu clusters exhibit significantly higher catalytic activity than Cu single atoms, consistent with the well-estimated size effect reported in the literature.22 Notably, the Ru1CunSiO2 catalyst not only lowered the temperature required for full conversion compared to its monometallic counterparts but also maintained a high ethylene selectivity even at full conversion. The slight decline in selectivity at high temperatures is attributed to the formation of C4 byproducts 1,3-butadiene and isobutylene, with no ethane production detected Figure S9. These results show that the Ru1CunSiO2 catalyst has an excellent ability to inhibit overhydrogenation. The substantial enhancement in catalytic activity observed for Ru1CunSiO2 compared to CunSiO2 highlights the critical role of Ru atoms in promoting hydrogenation activity. In contrast, Ru1SiO2 displayed negligible activity within the studied temperature range, indicating that Ru single atoms alone are not capable of catalyzing acetylene hydrogenation. Furthermore, a physical mixture of the two monometallic catalysts exhibited poor catalytic performance compared with Ru1CunSiO2, reinforcing that the observed enhancement arises from a genuine synergistic effect rather than a simple combination of the two supported metal catalysts. At 170 C, the specific activity of Ru1CunSiO2 was determined to be 34.02 molC d2H d2molCu 1h1, approximately 5.3 times higher than that of CunSiO2 Figure 3b. The kinetic analysis further confirmed the superior intrinsic activity of Ru1CunSiO2, revealing an apparent activation energy Ea of 42.23 kJmol, significantly lower than that of CunSiO2 60.72 kJmol Figure 3c. These results comprehensively confirm that Ru single atoms and Cu clusters synergistically enhanced the acetylene hydrogenation performance of Ru1CunSiO2. As a result, the Ru1CunSiO2 catalyst achieves full conversion at markedly lower temperatures and imparts outstanding ethylene selectivity for acetylene semihydrogenation. Additionally, Ru1CunSiO2 maintained excellent catalytic performance under high gas hourly space velocity GHSV conditions, achieving complete conversion below 200 C while sustaining ethylene selectivity above 90 Figure S10. Catalyst stability is a crucial factor in the long-term viability of acetylene semihydrogenation. To evaluate the durability of Ru1CunSiO2, continuous reaction tests were",

Catalyst stability is a crucial factor in the long-term viability of acetylene semihydrogenation. To evaluate the durability of Ru1CunSiO2, continuous reaction tests were conducted under the conditions of complete conversion T 170 C and high acetylene conversion about 90, T 165 C, respectively. As shown in Figure 3d, the Ru1CunSiO2 catalyst showed exceptional stability at high conversion, maintaining its activity without noticeable deactivation for over 20 h. Moreover, a durability test under full conversion conditions confirmed that the ethylene selectivity remained stable for over 55 h, indicating a high structural stability of the catalyst Figure S11. The exceptional stability of the Ru1CunSiO2 catalyst can be attributed to the following factors. The decreased reaction temperature for complete acetylene conversion suppresses the formation of C4 byproducts, while maintaining high ethylene selectivity at high acetylene conversion, thus reducing the risk of inactivation due to the accumulation of C4 byproducts. To further benchmark the catalytic performance of Ru1Cun SiO2, we compared its catalytic performance with that of state- of-the-art catalysts reported in the literature Table S5. The specific activity, measured as the volume of acetylene converted per minute per gram of active metal, was determined Journal of the American Chemical Society pubs.acs.orgJACS Article https:doi.org10.1021jacs.5c03713 J.

Notably, Ru1CunSiO2 not only achieves complete conversion but also maintains high ethylene selectivity, surpassing that of most literature-reported catalysts Figure 3e. These comparative results show the exceptional catalytic efficiency and promising potential of Ru1CunSiO2 for acetylene semihydrogenation. Additionally, a series of RuxCu0.5SiO2 catalysts with different Ru loadings x ranges from 0.02 to 0.5 wt were prepared by simply adjusting the amount of Ru precursor. The catalytic performance of these RuxCu0.5SiO2 catalysts with different RuCu ratios for the semihydrogenation of acetylene is shown in Figure S12. It is found that when the Ru loading is reduced to 0.02 wt , the Ru0.02Cu0.5SiO2 catalyst achieves complete acetylene conversion at 170 C with an ethylene selectivity of 93.6. The results reveal that the promotion of hydrogenation catalytic performance can still be obtained by introducing only small amounts of Ru single atoms. However, when the Ru loading increased to 0.5 wt , a decrease in catalytic activity was observed. This is possibly due to the formation of Ru clusters in Ru0.5Cu0.5SiO2 with an increase in Ru loading, leading to a decrease in the number of Ru single atom and Cu cluster active sites. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the key role of the synergistic interplay between Ru1Cun dual sites in Ru1CunSiO2 in greatly enhancing the catalytic performance. Reaction Mechanism Study.

The temperature at which HD formation is detected serves as an indicator of the H2 activation. For Ru1CunSiO2, the HD signal initiates at 47 C, closely resembling the behavior of Ru1SiO2 45 C, suggesting that Ru single atoms in Ru1CunSiO2 serve as the primary active sites for H2 dissociation. In contrast, CunSiO2 exhibits a significantly higher HD formation temperature of 83 C, indicating a weaker hydrogen activation capability of Cu clusters compared to Ru single atoms. These findings strongly suggest that Ru atoms in the Ru1CunSiO2 catalyst play a pivotal role in H2 activation, thereby facilitating the hydro- genation process. To further investigate the acetylene adsorption behavior, we performed temperature-programmed desorption TPD experiments Figure S14. The C2H2-TPD profiles of both Ru1CunSiO2 and CunSiO2 catalysts exhibit a desorption peak at 135 C, likely due to the C2H2 desorption on the isolated Cu atoms. Moreover, Ru1CunSiO2 displays a distinct desorption peak at 214 C, corresponding to moderate acetylene adsorption on fully exposed Cu clusters. However, CunSiO2 exhibits a high-temperature peak at 243 C, associated with strong acetylene adsorption on larger Cu clusters or particles. Excessive acetylene adsorption is known to promote the undesired acetylene coupling reaction, thereby diminishing ethylene selectivity. These results confirm that fully exposed Cu clusters serve as the primary acetylene adsorption sites in Ru1CunSiO2, striking a balance between sufficient acetylene activation and suppression of undesired side reactions. To assess the intrinsic reactivity of Ru1CunSiO2 and Cun SiO2 in acetylene hydrogenation, we conducted temperature- programmed surface reaction TPSR analyses using ethylene signals as a probe for CC bond activation Figure S15. The TPSR profile for CunSiO2 exhibits an ethylene formation peak at 215 C, with the reaction onset occurring at 88 C. The relatively high temperature required for hydrogenation activation suggests a limited H2 activation ability of Cun SiO2 after acetylene adsorption. In contrast, Ru1CunSiO2 exhibits a distinct peak at 162 C, with the reaction onset occurring at a significantly lower temperature of 45 C. This lower hydrogenation temperature indicates that Ru1CunSiO2 exhibits enhanced catalytic activity, attributed to the efficient H2 dissociation on Ru single atoms, which facilitates the hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene. These findings demonstrate that the cooperative interaction between Ru single atoms and Cu clusters in Ru1CunSiO2 significantly enhances the efficiency of acetylene hydrogenation with acetylene and hydrogen adsorbed on distinct metal sites, enabling ethylene formation at lower temperatures compared to monometallic Cu catalysts. To gain deeper mechanistic insights into the acetylene hydrogenation process on the Ru1CunSiO2 catalyst, we conducted density functional theory DFT calculations using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package VASP.33,34 The PerdewBurkeErnzerhof PBE functional within the generalized gradient approximation GGA was employed for electronic structure calculations,35 in",

To gain deeper mechanistic insights into the acetylene hydrogenation process on the Ru1CunSiO2 catalyst, we conducted density functional theory DFT calculations using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package VASP.33,34 The PerdewBurkeErnzerhof PBE functional within the generalized gradient approximation GGA was employed for electronic structure calculations,35 in addition, DFT-D3 was exploited to account for the vdW interactions.36 Given the partial hydroxylation of the silica support under the experimental conditions, a hydroxylated-SiO2 model is constructed to represent the SiO2 surface Figure S16. Based on the average CuCu coordination numbers derived from EXAFS analysis, we selected Cu3 and RuCu3 as model catalysts, respectively denoted as Cu3hydroxylated-SiO2 Figure S17 and RuCu3hydroxylated-SiO2 Figure S18. During catalyst preparation and under in situ H2 conditions, Cu3 and RuCu3 may undergo hydrogenation and dehydrox- ylation. To account for these effects, we systematically modified the structures by adding or removing either hydrogen or water molecules, generating catalyst models with varying stoichiometries. Finally, the most stable configurations of Cu3 and RuCu3 catalysts were determined using ab initio thermodynamics Figures S17 and S18. The results show that under the reaction conditions, the most stable RuCu3 cluster always bears two adsorbed hydrogen atoms; therefore, it will be notated as 2HRuCu3hydroxylated-SiO2 in the following text. The most stable structure of Cu3 is labeled as Cu3hydroxylated-SiO2. The two selected catalyst structures are putative global minima under the reaction conditions 170 C and 0.1 bar of H2, with the optimized structure shown in Figure S19. The distinct electronic structure of Cu clusters in Cu3 and RuCu3 catalysts is confirmed by Bader charge analysis Figure S20. The Bader charge analysis reveals a positively charged Cuδ state in the RuCu3 cluster. Moreover, there is a charge transfer to Cu of about 0.1e per Cu atom, resulting in an increased electron density on Cu in 2HRuCu3hydroxylated- SiO2. Meanwhile, the local density of states LDOS analysis Figure S21 indicates lower d-band energies in the 2HRuCu3hydroxylated-SiO2 catalyst, leading to weakened C2H4 adsorption. C2H2 shows a π adsorption configuration on both Cu3 and RuCu3 surfaces Figure S22. We further analyzed the reaction pathways and energy barriers for acetylene hydrogenation on Cu3hydroxylated- Journal of the American Chemical Society pubs.acs.orgJACS Article https:doi.org10.1021jacs.5c03713 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2025, 147, 1980819816 19812 SiO2 and 2HRuCu3hydroxylated-SiO2 catalysts Figure 4. On the Cu3 catalyst, the initial H2 dissociation step exhibits a free energy barrier of 1.31 eV TSH1, black, indicating the difficulty of H2 activation. The free energy barriers for the C H bond formation steps are determined as 1.16 eV TS1, the first CH bond formation, black and 1.21 eV TS2, the second CH bond formation, black, leading to ethylene generation from the C2H3 intermediate. In contrast, on the 2HRuCu3hydroxylated-SiO2 catalyst, the first CH bond formation preferentially involves the hydrogen atoms that are preadsorbed at CuCu hollow sites on the RuCu3 cluster surface. This step exhibits a free energy barrier of 0.73 eV TS1, red, which is 0.43 eV lower than that of the Cu3 catalyst, corroborating the critical role of Ru-modification",

This step exhibits a free energy barrier of 0.73 eV TS1, red, which is 0.43 eV lower than that of the Cu3 catalyst, corroborating the critical role of Ru-modification in enhancing the hydrogenation activity of acetylene. Notably, the second CH bond formation follows the EleyRideal E-R mechanism37 in which the HH dissociation and CH bond formation occur simultaneously. This step exhibits a free energy barrier of 1.74 eV TSH1-TS2, red. According to the energetic span model,38 the TS1 red and TS1 black render the TOF determining transition state TDTS because they represent the highest points on the free energy profiles, and C2H4 g and C2H4 are the TOF determining intermediates TDI considering they have the lowest free energies, for RuCu3 and Cu3, respectively. Finally, the energetic span ΔGs that governs the reactivity could be formulated as38 G G G G TDTS TDI s r in which GTDTS is the free energy of TDTS, GTDI is the free energy of TDI, and ΔrG is the reaction Gibbs energy, considering that the TDI comes after TDTS. Finally, it is clear that the free energy span from RuCu3 0.77 eV is much smaller than that of Cu3 1.43 eV. This matches well with previous experimental results, showing the superior activity of the RuCu3 catalyst. In Figure 4, we only showed the pathways toward ethylene, and the subsequent hydrogenation toward ethane is also demonstrated in Figures S23 and S24, with the raw energies of key structures for each pathway shown in Tables S6S8, respectively. The free energy barrier for further hydrogenation of the C2H4 intermediate on the 2HRuCu3 catalyst is 1.99 eV, which is slightly higher than that on the Cu3 catalyst TS3, 1.88 eV, and the ethylene desorption is more feasible on 2HRuCu3. Nevertheless, the energy barriers required for further hydrogenation on both catalysts are higher than those required for the desorption of C2H4 to the gas phase from the catalyst surface Figure 4, ensuring the timely desorption of ethylene. Consequently, it can be concluded that the 2HRuCu3hydroxylated-SiO2 catalyst exhibits both high ethylene selectivity and high reactivity. These computational findings are in excellent agreement with the experimental results, reinforcing a more efficient ethylene formation pathway in the 2HRuCu3hydroxylated-SiO2 catalyst. Theoretical calculations reveal that the exceptional perform- ance of the Ru1CunSiO2 catalyst originates from the synergistic interplay between Ru single atoms and fully exposed Cu clusters. Ru atoms serve as highly efficient H2 adsorptiondissociation sites, significantly lowering the activa- tion barriers and ensuring a steady supply of active hydrogen species for acetylene hydrogenation. Meanwhile, Cu clusters facilitate moderate acetylene adsorption, preventing excessive accumulation, which could lead to catalyst deactivation and undesired side reactions. The hydrogen species generated on the Ru sites migrate to Cu clusters, where they participate in the hydrogenation reaction, effectively reducing the energy barrier for ethylene formation. This cooperative mechanism not only enhances catalytic activity but also maintains high ethylene",

This cooperative mechanism not only enhances catalytic activity but also maintains high ethylene selectivity, highlighting the crucial role of RuCu synergy in optimizing the reaction pathway. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights the exceptional performance of Ru1Cun SiO2 for acetylene semihydrogenation driven by the synergistic effect of Ru single atoms and fully exposed Cu clusters. Ru single atoms enhance H2 activation, significantly boosting the catalytic activity and lowering the full-conversion temperature to 170 C while maintaining 98 ethylene selectivity. Meanwhile, Cu clusters optimize acetylene adsorption, preventing the strong binding of C2H2 and promoting selective hydrogenation.

Herein, we propose a phosphorus P-doping mediation strategy to introduce an oxygen vacancy into the Cu2O lattice, resulting in a C2 Faradaic efficiency of 87.0 at a partial current density of 347.8 mAcm2. Mechanistic studies unveil that P dopants dynamically regulate the formation of high-density oxygen vacancies in Cu2O lattices through the formation and subsequent detachment of the PO bond, predominantly in the form of phosphite within an aqueous electrolyte environment. In situ Raman spectroscopy coupled with density functional theory calculations further reveals that the OV-rich structure optimizes the surface coverage of active CO intermediates. This microenvironment not only accelerates the energetically favorable CC coupling pathway but also suppresses competitive protonation reactions, thereby breaking the intrinsic activity-selectivity trade-off. Our work provides atomic-level insights into defect dynamics manipulation for designing high-rate CO2 conversion systems. KEYWORDS: oxygen vacancy, P-doping mediation, CO2 reduction reaction, CO intermediate, multicarbon products INTRODUCTION The excessive use of fossil fuels at the expense of increasing global carbon emissions has caused irreversible climatic changes. The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction CO2RR, which converts CO2 into high-value-added and easily storable chemical energy, is an environmentally friendly approach with the potential to alleviate the energy crisis.1 Cu- based electrocatalysts have garnered significant attention due to the optimal CO binding energy on the Cu surface, facilitating CC coupling to C2 products. Up until now, a substantial number of researches have made considerable developments of Cu-based electrocatalysts through various strategies, including doping,24 ligand modification,57 do- main-limited space construction,8,9 and defects engineer- ing.1012 However, the sluggish kinetics and high CC coupling energy barrier of the CO2RR process, which involves multiple proton-coupled electron transfer, require high over- potential, leading to low selectivity C2 products. The creation of oxygen vacancies OVs is an effective strategy for the above issues, boosting the CO2RR performance by concurrently modifying the electronic structure and surface reactivity.13 The OVs, serving as fingerprint of the electronic structure of the catalysts, can effectively promote the transfer of electrons to the adsorbed CO2, thus lowering the energy barrier for CO2 electroreduction by enhancing CO2 activation and the adsorption of key intermediates.14,15 Second, it has been demonstrated that the presence of OVs enhances the charge transfer efficiency at the catalytic reaction interface by decreasing the charge transfer resistance, thus increasing the electrocatalytic reaction rate.15,16 Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that OVs can effectively suppress competitive HER activity by modulating the adsorption energy and electronic configuration of CO2RR intermediaries.17 Thus, it is of significant importance to develop Cu-based catalysts enriched with OVs.

Nevertheless, the concentration and distribution of OVs exhibit high sensitivity to the synthesis conditions such as temperature,18 pressure,19 and gas composition.20 This sensitivity makes it challenging to achieve precise and reproducible control of OVs.21 In addition, despite Received: March 17, 2025 Revised: May 24, 2025 Accepted: May 27, 2025 Article www.acsnano.org XXXX American Chemical Society A https:doi.org10.1021acsnano.5c04602 ACS Nano XXXX, XXX, XXXXXX Downloaded via TSINGHUA UNIV on June 15, 2025 at 12:43:38 UTC. See https:pubs.acs.orgsharingguidelines for options on how to legitimately share published articles. the overall CO2RR being a reductive process, the presence of CO2 and potential intermediate products can generate a relatively oxidizing microenvironment. Oxygen in CO2 or other oxygen-containing species may fill the OVs, reducing their concentration and affecting the catalytic activity.22 When the partial pressure of CO2 is high, the probability of oxygen filling the vacancies increases. Therefore, these factors pose critical challenges for precise synthesis of Cu-based catalyst enriched OVs, as well as maintaining long-term stability in a desired state for optimal catalytic performance. Herein, we proposed a P-doping mediation strategy to precisely control the formation of OVs, combining the one- step liquid-phase method to obtain a surface P-doped Cu2O as-prepared PCu2O at room temperature and the in situ electrochemical pre-reduction process to achieve the successful construction of OVs OVsCu2O. The P-dopant is the key factor for the rapid formation of substantial OVs in the Cu2O lattice, primarily through the formation and subsequent detachment of PO bonds. The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy UPS demonstrates that the OVs function as charge carriers, thereby facilitating electron transfer during the CO2RR. In situ Raman analysis indicates that the presence of OVs enhances the adsorption of CO intermediates, thus promoting the selectivity for C2 products. As a result, the OVsCu2O electrocatalysts achieved a C2 Faradaic efficiency FE of 87.0 at partial current density of 347.8 mAcm2, along with stable performance exceeding 30 h in a membrane electrode assembly MEA electrolyzer. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Synthesis and Characterization. The OVsCu2O catalysts were synthesized through a two-step process involving P-doping follow by an in situ electrochemical reduction process Figures 1a and S1. Due to the significant electronegativity difference between P 2.19 and O 3.44, the electron cloud of P with electron-donating ability tends to shift toward O.23 This leads to a strong binding tendency between P and O, thereby facilitating the formation of PO bonds. The second- step of the in situ electrochemical reduction process plays a crucial role in accelerating the detachment of PO bonds, leading to the departure of O atoms from the Cu2O lattice and thus forming OVs to obtain OVsCu2O.24,25 The PO bonds desorb as P-containing species from the catalyst surface into the electrolyte such as phosphate, phosphite, or hypophos- phite in an aqueous electrolyte.

The XRD patterns exhibit the distinctive diffraction peaks of as-prepared PCu2O and reference Cu2O Figure 1e, which index well to the Cu2O phase JCPDS 05-0667. Notably, compared with the reference Cu2O, the diffraction peaks of as-prepared P Cu2O exhibit a slight shift toward a lower angle Figure 1f, which is possibly caused by the introduction of P.26,27 Additionally, the Cu LMM spectra confirm the presence of Cu in both as-prepared PCu2O and reference Cu2O Figure 1g. These characterization results collectively indicate the successful synthesis of both PCu2O and reference Cu2O. In the second step, the as-prepared PCu2O and reference Cu2O undergo an in situ electrochemical reduction process pre-reduction process to obtain Cu2O enrich OVs OVs Cu2O and pre-reduced reference Cu2O. Scanning electron microscopy SEM and TEM images reveal that both the OVsCu2O Figures S2c,d and S5a and pre-reduced reference Cu2O Figure S3c,d nanoparticles exhibit increased particle sizes and display similar morphologies. The EDS elemental maps of the OVsCu2O clearly demonstrate the depletion of P during the pre-reduction process Figure S5b, which aligns with our anticipated catalyst design objectives and exhibits a compositional profile similar to that of the pre- reduced reference Cu2O. Moreover, the quasi-in situ XRD spectra revealed that, after the pre-reduction process, a fraction of Cu2O in both OVsCu2O and the pre-reduced reference Cu2O transformed into Cu Figure S6.

To further investigate the relationship between PO bonds formation, PO bonds detachment, and the rapid, extensive OVs formation, a series of comprehensive characterization analyses were conducted. According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS characterization analysis, the peak located at 133.18 eV in the P 2p spectra is ascribed to the PO bonds Figure 2.

Correspond- ingly, a significant number of OVs were simultaneously formed on the surface of OVsCu2O following the pre-reduction process, as evidenced by the analysis of the O 1s spectrum. The three peaks detected at 530.15, 531.38, and 532.85 eV of the OVsCu2O are attributed to lattice oxygen Olatt, OVs, and adsorbed oxygen Oads,3032 respectively Figure 2b. A comparison between the as-prepared PCu2O and OVs Cu2O samples indicates that the OVsCu2O catalysts possess the highest concentration of OVs Table S1. To provide direct evidence of the construction of OVs during the pre- reduction process, in situ electron paramagnetic resonance EPR characterization was performed at a constant current of 5.0 mA. The result demonstrated that the persistence of OVs during the pre-reduction process and the concentration increased with the extension of the reduction time, which preliminarily confirmed the mechanism of OVs formation Figure 2c. Furthermore, quasi-in situ EPR was performed for the PCu2O and the reference Cu2O catalysts. Compared to the as-prepared PCu2O and reference Cu2O catalysts Figure 2f, both the OVsCu2O and the OVsCu2O after CO2RR exhibit a more pronounced signal peak at g 2.003 Figure 2e. Moreover, the catalysts after the CO2RR were characterized by XPS, and the O 1s spectra are displayed in Figure S7.

This is attributed to the electronegativity of P 2.19, which is larger than that of Cu 1.90, thus resulting the charge transfer between Cu atoms and P atoms.26 The phenomenon of electron transfer can also be verified from the Cu 2p spectra. The peaks located at 932.99 and 952.78 eV are attributed to Cu 2p32 and Cu 2p12 of Cu or Cu0, respectively Figure S8. With the introduction of P, the binding energies of Cu 2p32 and 2p12 have a significant positive shift, which further identifies the effect of electron transfer on the surface of the electrocatalysts.36 In contrast, the peak position of Cu 2p32 and 2p12 of the OVsCu2O has a clear negative shift, which may be due to the transfer of hole electrons on the OVs, thus leading Cu atoms in an electron-rich state.18,37,38 Due to the unavoidable partial oxidation of the samples during the delivery process, shoulder peaks of Cu2 are observed at 934.70 and 955.08 eV.12 The P-containing species in the electrolyte were subsequently characterized using ion chroma- tography IC. The results indicate that the majority of the detached P exists in the electrolyte primarily as phosphite Figures S9S11 and Table S2, which is consistent with the presence of PO bonds observed in the P 2p spectrum of the as-prepared PCu2O. All characterization results unambigu- ously confirm that the introduction of P and the construction of OVs can effectively engineer the charge redistribution, thereby facilitating CO2 activation.

To gain further insights into the mechanism by which P dopants mediate the formation of OVs, we conducted density functional theory DFT calculations. According to the experimental characterizations, Cu2O200 was selected to study the effects of P dopant on the OVs formation. The pristine Cu2O200 and its corresponding P-doped models are shown Figure 2g. The OVs formation energy ΔEOVs,formation was employed to describe the tendency of OVs formation caused by P dopants, which was defined by ΔEOVs,formation EOVs EO EnPCu d2O200, where EOVs and EnPCu d2O200 represented the electronic energy of the P-doped models with and without OVs, respectively. EO was calculated from EH d2O and EH d2 EH d2O EH d2. The more negative the ΔEOVs,formation, the more likely to form OVs over Cu2O. Figure 2d demonstrates that the ΔEOVs,formation exhibits a tendency to decrease with an increase in the PCu ratio of the surface phase, suggesting that P dopants can contribute to the generation of OVs. When the ratio of PCu approaches to 0.6, the ΔEOVs,formation is demonstrably lower than that of pristine Cu2O, indicating that higher P dopant level is more likely to form OVs compared to pristine Cu2O. Moreover, the ratio of PCu in the surface phase of PCu2O, as determined by XPS Table S3, falls within the higher PCu ratio interval 0.5 to 0.7. Theoretical calculations further indicate that a higher concentration of P dopants can change the surface configuration of PCu2O, especially the oxygen coordination environments, for example, PO and CuO bonds, which would contribute to the formation of OVs during pre- reduction process Figure S12. Consequently, experimental characterizations in conjunction with DFT calculations indicate that the P-doped Cu2O catalyst facilitated the expeditious and extensive formation of OVs during the pre- reduction process. Electrocatalytic Performance in Flow Cell and MEA. The CO2RR activity of OVsCu2O and pre-reduced reference Cu2O catalysts was evaluated in a flow cell with 1.0 M KHCO3 electrolyte. Figure 3a shows the linear sweeping voltammetry LSV curve of OVsCu2O and pre-reduced reference Cu2O in CO2 and N2 atmospheres. Notably, under a CO2 atmosphere, the total current density of OVsCu2O was significantly higher than that of pre-reduced reference Cu2O at applied potentials lower than 1.2 V vs AgAgCl, indicating the enhanced CO2RR activity attributed to the presence of OVs. Given that the majority of the detached P primarily exists in the electrolyte as phosphite, to eliminate the potential interference of phosphite on the CO2RR performance, the electrolyte is completely drained following the pre-reduction step and subsequently replaced with fresh electrolyte for the subsequent CO2RR tests. As expected, no significant difference in the CO2RR performance was observed Table S4, which further corroborates that the activity enhancement of OVs Cu2O is attributable to the OVs. As illustrated in Figure 3b,c, OVsCu2O demonstrates a significantly higher selectivity for C2 products, including C2H4, C2H5OH, CH3COOH, and C3H7OH, compared to the pre-reduced reference Cu2O.

    "text": "was observed Table S4, which further corroborates that the activity enhancement of OVs Cu2O is attributable to the OVs. As illustrated in Figure 3b,c, OVsCu2O demonstrates a significantly higher selectivity for C2 products, including C2H4, C2H5OH, CH3COOH, and C3H7OH, compared to the pre-reduced reference Cu2O. To be specific, the FEC2 of OVsCu2O electrode exceeds 80.0 in a broad current density range of 350 450 mAcm2 and reaches a topmost FEC d2 of 87.0 at a partial current density of 347.8 mAcm2, with 46.1 for FEC d2H d4 and 31.5 for FEC d2H d5OH. In comparison, the pre-reduced reference Cu2O exhibits lower selectivity, with the maximum FE for C2 products reaching only 63.1, whereas the FE for CO remains consistently above 20. Furthermore, the FEC2 Figure 3d and C2 partial current density Figure 3e of OVsCu2O are significantly higher than those of the pre-reduced reference Cu2O across the entire potential range. Especially, at a current density of 450 mA cm2, the value of FEC d2C d1 reaches 12.0, which is over- whelmingly superior to pre-reduced reference Cu2O Figure 3f. Moreover, a comparison has been made between OVs Cu2O and the currently available catalysts Table S5. The results demonstrate that OVsCu2O displays both excellent C2 product selectivity and partial current density in near- neutral electrolytes. Furthermore, to verify the modulation mechanism of P-doping-induced OVs construction on CO2RR performance, a series of PCu2O catalysts with different P doping concentrations were obtained by adjusting the addition of P source during the synthesis process. The feeding versus corresponding ICP-verified CuP ratios in the freshly prepared PCu2O catalysts revealed that the P-doping concentration increased progressively with a higher P precursor dosage until reaching saturation as the feeding molar ratio reached 1.5:1 Table S6. Subsequently, the EPR characterization of the series of OVs-rich Cu catalysts obtained by the pre-reduction treatment of PCu2O samples was conducted. The results revealed that the OVs concentration gradually increased with growing P-doping concentration Figure S13. Notably, the CO2RR product analysis of the OVs-enriched Cu catalysts indicated that the FEC2 exhibited an upward trend with increasing P-doping concentrations, while the competing C1 and H2 byproducts decreased inversely Figure S14. These findings substantiate that P-doping modulates the OVs concentration, providing further insights into the mechanism of P-doping-mediated OVs formation. Long-term electro- chemical stability is a critical parameter that significantly influences the performance of CO2RR.

During prolonged CO2RR stability assessments at high current densities, continuous electron transfer and proton coupling processes on the catalyst surface result in a reduction of the OVs concentration. This CO2RR- induced process leads to a reconfiguration of the local charge distribution surrounding the OVs, thereby causing a time- dependent decay in the concentration of OVs.

This CO2RR- induced process leads to a reconfiguration of the local charge distribution surrounding the OVs, thereby causing a time- dependent decay in the concentration of OVs. As illustrated in Figure S15, the presence of OVs in OVsCu2O remains evident after a 30 h CO2RR stability test, implying the stability of the OVs in Cu2O catalysts. Mechanistic Study. We conducted a series of character- izations to further elucidate the mechanism of OVs in enhancing the CO2RR activity. The electrochemically active surface area ECSA usually affects CO2RR activity, which was measured by double-layer capacitance Cdl on the basis of cyclic voltammograms for the OVsCu2O and pre-reduced reference Cu2O Figure S16. It is evident that the ECSA values of the two electrocatalysts are relatively similar Figure S17, indicating that ECSA is not a primary factor influencing the difference in the CO2RR performance. Usually, the interfacial properties of the electrode and electrolyte also affect the CO2RR process. Therefore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed on the electrocatalysts at open circuit potential OCP, and Nyquist plots were obtained for both OVsCu2O and pre-reduced reference Cu2O electrocatalysts. The OVsCu2O exhibits a lower charge transfer resistance Rct, which facilitates enhanced interfacial charge transfer kinetics during the CO2RR process Figure S18. To explore the origin of the fast kinetics and excellent CO2RR activity of OVsCu2O, UPS measurement was carried out to evaluate its electron-donating ability. The work function, which is obtained from the UPS spectra according to the equation: Eφ hα Ecutoff EFermi,39 of the OVsCu2O 3.68 eV is significantly smaller than that of the pre-reduced reference Cu2O 4.34 eV Figure 4a, suggesting that the OVs decrease the energy barrier of electrons from the electrocatalyst surface to the reactants and intermediates during the CO2RR process.40 Furthermore, the valence band of the catalyst can be obtained without bias, as shown in Figure 4b, and the valence band position of OVsCu2O is 1.87 eV, which is closer to the Fermi energy level than that of the pre-reduced reference Cu2O 2.08 eV. According to previous studies, as the center of the d-band of the material gets closer to the Fermi energy Figure 4. Strong electron-donating ability and CO adsorption of OVsCu2O.

    "text": "absorption of the intermediates on the electrocatalyst surface could be intensified.18,41 The in situ Raman spectroscopy was employed to provide further insights into the adsorption behavior of the CO intermediate over the electrocatalysts during the CO2RR Figures 4c and S19. At OCP, both OVsCu2O and pre- reduced reference Cu2O catalysts exhibit two main Raman peaks at 524 and 625 cm1, which correspond to the signature peaks of Cu2O.4244 As the potential increased to 0.7 V vs AgAgCl, a distinct CuCO bond stretching vibration peak was observed at approximately 365 cm1, which demonstrate the appearance of CO intermediates on OVsCu2O electrode during CO2RR.4547 In comparison, the pre-reduced reference Cu2O exhibited a notably lower peak intensity of CuCO species within the same energy range, indicating an enhanced capacity for CO generation on the OVsCu2O electrode. Meanwhile, the characteristic CuCO peaks of the pre-reduced reference Cu2O only emerged when the voltage was increased to 1.3 V vs AgAgCl, which is more negative than the onset potential for CO adsorption on OVsCu2O. Furthermore, these peaks disappeared at 1.7 V vs AgAgCl, a potential that is more positive compared to the disappearance potential of CO adsorption on OVsCu2O 1.8 V vs Ag AgCl. The adsorption of CO on the OVsCu2O over a wide potential range from 0.7 V to 1.7 V vs AgAgCl further suggests that OVs facilitate the adsorption of CO intermediate to promote CC coupling and improve the selectivity of C2 products.48,49 In addition, electrochemical CO stripping voltammetry was employed to evaluate and compare the CO desorption performance of OVsCu2O and pre-reduced reference Cu2O. A pronounced CO stripping profile with a prominent peak at approximately 0.12 V vs Ag AgCl was observed for OVsCu2O Figure S20, while the corresponding peak for pre-reduced reference Cu2O appeared at around 0.03 V vs AgAgCl. The positive shift indicates a stronger CO adsorption on the OVsCu2O electrode, which is consistent with the conclusion of the in situ Raman experiments.50,51 CC coupling is usually considered as the rate-determining step in the conversion of CO2 to C2 products. Extensive research has shown that this process can be more effectively initiated by enhancing the adsorption of the key intermediate CO. To further substantiate the impact of OVs on the adsorption of CO, we conducted DFT calculations. First, the calculated binding energies of CO on Cu2O200 and Cu2O2004OV four OV sites over the surface are 0.94 eV and 1.61 eV Figure 4d, respectively, suggesting that the presence of OVs intensifies the adsorption of CO on the OVsCu2O electrode, which is in agreement with the above-mentioned in situ Raman and CO stripping results. Furthermore, the results of the Bader charge analysis indicate that the OVs enhance the charge transferred from Cu to CO adsorbed on Cu2O2004OV in comparison with Cu2O200, thus strengthening the adsorption of CO, which is conducive to subsequent CC coupling. Then, DFT calculations were performed to analyze the Gibbs free energy ΔG evolution of the CO2RR process. Based on the experimental results, it is known that almost all of",

Then, DFT calculations were performed to analyze the Gibbs free energy ΔG evolution of the CO2RR process. Based on the experimental results, it is known that almost all of the Cu2O material was reduced into metallic Cu during the pre-reduced process, so the fully reduced Cu2O200 with massive OVs, obtained by removing all of the O atoms from Cu2O200, was used for the subsequent CO2RR analysis. As a comparison, the CO2RR over the pristine Cu2O200 was also analyzed to study the effect of OVs on the crucial CC coupling step. The optimized configurations for the adsorption of different intermediates are displayed Figure S21. As depicted in Figure 4e, we found that the generation energy barrier of OCCO is 1.11 eV on fully reduced Cu2O200, which is noticeably lower than 1.73 eV observed on Cu2O200. The energy reduction from Cu2O200 to fully reduced Cu2O- 200 reveals that the presence of OVs facilitates CC coupling, further promoting CO2 conversion to C2 products. Additionally, the effects of OVs induced by P dopants on the reduction of C2 intermediates were further analyzed Figures S22 and S23, which revealed that the OVs can contribute to the generation of gaseous C2H4 and liquid products CH3CH2OH by decreasing the energy difference between CHCHO and CHCOH intermediates. In combination with the CO coupling Figure 4e, it is found that the limiting step for the generation of C2 products on Cu2O200 is from the CC coupling process, while OVs improve the CC coupling step, and the limiting step on fully reduced Cu2O200 is from the hydrogenation of the C2 intermediate OCCOH H eHOCCOH. Therefore, OVs modulate the electrochemical process to change the distribu- tion of C2 products, as reflected in Figure 3. CONCLUSIONS In summary, our work presents a catalyst enriched with OVs to achieve a high selectivity of 87.0 at a partial current density of 347.8 mAcm2 and stability over 30 h for the CO2RR toward C2 products. The experimental results, in situ characterization and DFT calculations provide solid evidence that the introduction of OVs enable selective adsorptionactivation of CO2 and reduction of energy barriers for CO2RR, thus promoting CC coupling and enhancing the selectivity of C2 products. These findings hold promise for providing clear insights into the production of OVs on Cu-based catalysts and developing a highly selective catalyst design strategy to boost the CO2RR activity. METHODS AND EXPERIMENTS Synthesis of OVsCu2O and Pre-reduced Reference Cu2O. The synthesis OVsCu2O catalysts were done through a two-step method involving P-doping followed by in situ electrochemical reduction process. First, the PCu2O electrocatalyst was synthesized by a one-step liquid-phase method at room temperature. Specifically, 0.1 g of CuCl22H2O and 0.04 g of NaH2PO2 were dissolved in 10 mL of DI water to form a light blue solution. Then, 10 mL of 0.09 M NaBH4 solution was added dropwise to the above mixture under vigorous stirring. The color of the solution",

Then, 10 mL of 0.09 M NaBH4 solution was added dropwise to the above mixture under vigorous stirring. The color of the solution changed from light blue to brownish brown, followed by stirring for 2 h at room temperature and washing with isopropanol and DI water alternately to remove residual impurities. The samples collected via centrifugation were freezedried to obtain a PCu2O powder. The reference Cu2O can be obtained by replacing sodium hypophosphite as the phosphorus source with HCOONa. Subsequently, the samples were pre-reduced for 180 s at a constant current of 50 mA to obtain OVsCu2O and pre-reduced reference Cu2O catalysts. Electrochemical Measurements. All electrochemical perform- ance measurements and LSV were conducted in a flowing cell GOSREL, Cp10 with an active area of 1 1 cm2. The flow cell comprises a gas flow chamber, a cathode chamber, and an anode chamber, which are separated by an anion exchange membrane Fumasep-FAB-PK-130. The gas diffusion electrode GDE acts as the cathode, serving as a separator between the gas chamber and the cathode chamber. The GDE was prepared as follows: Initially, 8 mg of electrocatalyst was dispersed in 5 mL of isopropanol and 10 μL of ACS Nano www.acsnano.org Article https:doi.org10.1021acsnano.5c04602 ACS Nano XXXX, XXX, XXXXXX G Nafion solution. Then, the mixture was dispersed by sonication for 30 min to form a homogeneous ink. At last, the ink was sprayed to a 3 3 cm2 gas diffusion layer with a theoretical electrocatalyst loading of 0.88 mg cm2. The prepared working electrode 1 1 cm2 and nickel foam 1 1 cm2 were used as the cathode and anode, respectively. The constant current mode was employed for the measurements of the CO2RR. The current density conditions tested were 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, and 500 mAcm2, with a reaction time of 10 min. The electrolyte was 1.0 M KHCO3 and was continuously circulated in the cathode and anode chambers with a flow rate of 5 mLmin1 by using a peristaltic pump. The flow rate of CO2 at the inlet of the gas chamber is 30 sccm, and the outlet is directly connected to the gas chromatograph Shanghai Ruimin, GC2060, which can quantify the concentration of the gas products by means of a standard curve generated from the peak area of the standard mixture of H2, CH4, CO, and C2H4. Characterizations. SEM and TEM were employed to characterize the morphology and microstructure of the electrocatalysts. The crystallographic information and material composition for the samples were collected by XRD D8 Advance Bruker with Cu Kα X-ray radiation λ 1.5418 Å.

This study develops a cor- rosion strategy to construct a self-supported electrocatalyst Int-NiMoO2 with high mechanical stability by anchoring the NiMoO2 catalytic layer with a dense interlayer of MoO2 nanoparticles. The Int-NiMoO2 exhibits a strength- ened homostructural interface between the interlayer and catalytic layer, preventing the detachment of the catalyst during ultrasonic treatment. The blade-shaped catalytic layer reduces bubble shock and potential ﬂuctuations at high current densities up to 6000 mA cm2. As a result, the Int-NiMoO2 electrode exhibits a low overpotential of 73.2 14.2 mV and long-term stability for 6000 h at 1000 mA cm2 in a 1 M KOH solution. The Int-NiMoO2 assem- bled AEM-WE device demonstrates long-term stability at 1000 mA cm2 for 1000 h with a very low degradation rate of 3.96 µV h1. Ampere-scale anion exchange membrane water electrolysis AEM-WE is crucial for achieving a sustainable hydrogen economy14. The hydrogen evolution reaction HER at the cathode, which yields twice as much gas as the oxygen evolution reaction at the anode, is still limited by the lack of efﬁcient and stable electrocatalysts under harsh reaction conditions5,6. As the current is increased from the milliampere to ampere scale, inhibited electron transfer at the liquidsolid inter- face and limited mass transfer at the gasliquidsolid interface result in high overpotentials for the HER710. Moreover, the generation of massive bubbles causes uneven distributions of local stress and interfacial adhesion force, which may detach the catalyst layer from the electrode8,11,12. The above issues pose signiﬁcant challenges in designing electrodes with long-term stability. Polystyrene-based ionomers with high ion conductivities can reduce the overpotentials at high current densities in AEM-WE13,14, however, these binders cannot provide a strong adhesion force for catalysts during a fast HER, highlighting the need for the development of self-supported catalytic electrodes with enhanced catalyst-substrate interactions. Recent studies suggest that electrodes based on transition- metal oxides, sulﬁdes, or phosphides, through the in situ growth of a catalytic layer on the substrate, have demonstrated low degradation for over 100 h at high current densities 1000 mA cm21520. However, an ultrastable electrode capable of maintaining an ampere-scale current density for several thousand hours is still lacking because of weak electrostatic adsorption, mechanical interlocking, or intermolecular attractions at the heterostructure interface6,21. Therefore, reinforcing the interactions between the substrate and catalyst and mitigating the impact of bubbles on the interface remain major challenges in achieving long-term stability.

The interlayer transfers the bubble shock from the heterostructural interface between the substrate and the catalytic layer to the homostructural interface between the interlayer and the catalytic layer, enhancing the catalytic activity and stability in ampere-scale HER. In a 1 M KOH solution, Int-NiMoO2 exhibits an overpotential of 73.2 14.2 mV at 1000 mA cm2, signiﬁcantly lower than that of PtC 243.0 2.9 mV. Furthermore, it demonstrates good stability, operating for 6000 h without any discernible degradation. The Int-NiMoO2-assembled noble metal-free AEM-WE device achieves a high current density of 7570 mA cm2 at 2.0 V and a long-term sta- bility of 1000 h at 1000 mA cm2. Results and discussion Int-NiMoO2 was synthesised via a corrosion strategy by soaking the nickel foam NF in an NH46Mo7O24 solution with poly- vinylpyrrolidone PVP as the ligand Fig. S1 and S2. A blade-shaped structure was generated following the subsequent hydrothermal treatment Fig. S3. X-ray diffraction XRD patterns conﬁrmed that the heterostructure comprised conductive MoO2 and metallic Ni Fig. S4. Transmission electron microscopy TEM images of Int-NiMoO2 sug- gested that the sharp-tip structure contained numerous nanopores with an average size of 3.52 nm as determined by nitrogen adsorption- desorption measurements, which facilitated the mass transfer of the reactants and gas during electrocatalysis Fig. S5a, b. In addition, the high-angle annular dark-ﬁeld imaging-scanning transmission electron microscopy HAADF-STEM and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy EDX results showed that the Ni nanoparticles were uniformly dis- tributed on the MoO2 substrate Fig. S5ce, conﬁrming the hetero- structure of NiMoO2. Notably, the prepared Int-NiMoO2 exhibited high mechanical stability under ultrasonic treatment. A traditional rod-like NiMoMoO2 electrode was synthesised for comparison22 Figs. S6 and S7. As shown in Fig. 1b, the aqueous suspension of NiMoMoO2 turned black after 5 s of ultrasonication, indicating that the catalyst was shed from the NF a Nickel Foam Interlayer Catalytic Layer Nickel Foam Catalytic Layer 2 400 nm 50 nm 100 nm 0 s 5 s 1 min 30 min 1 h Int-NiMoO2 g h NiMoMoO2 Int-NiMoO2 0 s 1 h NiMoMoO2 0 s 1 h 20 20 20 20 Initial Int-NiMoO2 Initial After ultrasound After ultrasound NiMoMoO2 b e c Interlayer Gap",

In contrast, the solution with the Int-NiMoO2 electrode showed negligible colour change even after an hour of ultrasonic treatment, conﬁrming the high mechanical stability of the catalyst in Int-NiMoO2 Fig. S8. Moreover, the morphology of Int-NiMoO2 was maintained after ultrasonic treatment, as conﬁrmed by scanning electron microscopy SEM images Fig. 1c, d and Fig. S9, while the NF substrate in NiMoMoO2 was completely exposed after ultrasonication Fig. 1e, f and Fig. S10. The mass loss of Int-NiMoO2 during ultrasonic treatment 53 kHz was 7.5 1.7, signiﬁcantly lower than that of NiMo MoO2 69.9 1.9 shown in Fig. S11. To explore the reason for the mechanical stability of Int-NiMoO2, its brittle ruptured cross-sectional morphology was observed by SEM, where a sharp blade-shaped cata- lytic layer and a dense interlayer were observed on the surface of NF Fig. 1g. However, for the NiMoMoO2 electrode, the rod-like catalyst was directly loaded onto the NF substrate without an interlayer Fig. 1h. The dense interlayer in Int-NiMoO2 is composed of nano- particles measuring tens of nanometers, which act as a glue, attaching the catalytic layer tightly to the substrate and reinforcing the mechanical stability of the electrode Fig. 1a, especially at high current densities with severe bubble strikes.The SEM-EDX results revealed that the elemental composition of the interlayer was identical to that of the catalytic layer, consisting of Mo, Ni, and O Fig. S12. The soaking process was further studied to examine the char- acteristics of the interlayer. During the soaking process, the colourless solution turned yellowish in the initial 5 min owing to the chemical etching of the NF by Mo7O24 6-, as evidenced by the presence of Ni2 in the solution Fig. S13a. As the soaking time increased, a green pre- cipitate formed in the solution Fig. S13b, and the SEM images showed that the rough surface of the NF became smoother, suggesting that the precipitate might attach to the NF surface Fig. S14.

The X-ray pho- toelectron spectra XPS of the NF revealed increased contents of pyrrolic-N 397.8 eV and NH4 399.8 eV after soaking Fig. 2a. In addition, the peaks gradually shifted to higher binding energies, sug- gesting that PVP and NH4 were coordinated to the metal or metal ions and deposited on the NF Fig. S15. The blue shift of the CO stretching vibration for the soaked NF in the Fourier transform infrared FT-IR spectra also conﬁrmed that PVP was coordinated during the soaking process23 Fig. 2b. The SEM images of the soaked NF revealed that the surface contained C and Mo Fig. 2c and Fig. S16. Moreover, the structure of the substance deposited on NF was identical to that of the precipitate in the solution Fig. S17, and single-crystal XRD analysis conﬁrmed it to be polyoxometalate POM NH44H6Mo6NiO24 4H2O Fig. 2d and Fig. S18, which is similar to a previously reported structure24 Table S1. Based on the above results, the reactions of NF, NH46Mo7O24, and PVP during soaking are proposed as follows. First, NF is corroded by Mo7O24 6- to generate Ni2 Fig. S1. Then, Ni2 and Mo7O24 6- are restructured to form POMs with the assistance of the PVP ligand. Moreover, after the H2Ar treatment, the obtained POMs were converted to MoO2 Fig. 2e, which exhibited the same phase structure as the blade-shaped catalytic layer Fig. 2f.

Additionally, the grazing incidence X-ray diffraction GIXRD patterns of Int-NiMoO2 revealed different crystalline structures in the interlayer and catalytic layer Fig. 2g and Fig. S19. The exterior catalytic layer exhibited a broad peak at 36.8, corresponding to the 111 plane of MoO2. As the angle of incidence increased, a peak emerged 26.0, which was attributed to the 111 plane of MoO2, conﬁrming different crystallinities and orientations within the interlayer. The presence of a densely packed and highly crystalline interlayer is expected to improve mechanical stability during ultrasonic irradiation and enhance electrochemical stability at high current densities with intense mass transfer and gas collisions. The HER activity was measured in 1 M KOH, with HgHgO as the reference electrode and a graphite plate as the counter electrode. As shown in Fig. 3a, Int-NiMoO2 requires an overpotential of 46.4 10.8 mV at 500 mA cm2 Fig. S20, which is lower than those of NiMoMoO2 69.2 4.9 mV and PtC 154.0 4.3 mV. Moreover, when the current density is increased to 1000 mA cm2, the overpotential for Int-NiMoO2 only slightly increases to 73.2 14.2 mV. The normalised HER performance also conﬁrmed the high intrinsic activity of Int-Ni MoO2 Fig. S21. Moreover, multicurrent tests were conducted on Int- NiMoO2, NiMoMoO2, PtC, and commercial Pt on Ni cPtNi to eval- uate their catalytic stability under harsh conditions Fig. 3b. When the current density was increased to 6 A cm2, the overpotential of PtC sharply increased and exceeded the potential limit due to the weak adhesion strength of the binder. The NiMoMoO2 and cPtNi electrodes exhibited potential degradations of 195 and 85 mV, respectively, when the current density returned to 1 A cm2, which was attributed to 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 -0.5 0.0 0.5 V laitn eto P vs. RHE Time h -1 Current density: -1000 mA cm-2 Temperature: 25 C 1 M KOH 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 Voltage V Time h -1 Activation Int-NiMoO2 CAPist-L1 Electrolyte: 1 M KOH Temperature: 60 C Current density: 1000 mA cm-2 0 10 20 30 40 -2.0 -1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 V laitn eto P vs. RHE Time h Int-NiMoO2 NiMoMoO2 PtC cPtNi -1 A -1 A -2 A -2 A -3 A -3 A -6 A -0.5 A 0.0 0 NiMoMoO2 m c A s eitis n e d tn err u C -2 Potential V vs. RHE Int-NiMoO2 PtC a b d c 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 0 2 4 6 8 25 C 40 C 60 C 80 C m c A s eitis n e d tn err u",

However, Int- NiMoO2 with a dense homostructural interlayer, exhibited negligible degradation. Short-term stability measurements conﬁrmed the high catalytic stability of Int-NiMoO2 Fig. S22. SEM images of Int-NiMoO2 before and after the HER 100 h at 1000 mA cm2 demonstrate that the blade-shaped structure is well preserved Fig. S23. In contrast, the rod catalyst layer of NiMoMoO2 experienced extensive delamina- tion after the HER at a high current density Fig. S24. The XPS results indicated that Mo0 in NiMoMoO2 was oxidised to a higher valence state during catalysis Fig. S25. The enhanced mechanical stability of Int-Ni MoO2 ensured its high activity after ultrasonic treatment Fig. S26. Int- NiMoO2 also demonstrated better catalytic stability under current square-wave cycles than NiMoMoO2 in the accelerated stress test Fig. S2725. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of Int-NiMoO2 did not show noticeable degradation after operating for more than 1000 h Fig. 3c. Although the XRD and TEM results indicated that the structure of Int-NiMoO2 after the HER became amorphous Fig. S28a, b, its elemental composition and blade-shaped structure remained stable, as conﬁrmed by the TEM-EDX and SEM results Fig. S28c and S29. The faradaic efﬁciency FE of Int-NiMoO2 was 100 0.89 Fig. S30. Owing to its unique sharp blade-shaped morphology and interlayer structure, the electrocatalytic performance and stability of Int-NiMoO2 signiﬁcantly surpass those of other reported catalysts at ampere-scale current densities Fig. S31, Table S2 and S3. The performance of Int-NiMoO2 was further evaluated in an assembled AEM-WE cell in 1 M KOH. The previously reported NiFe- based anode CAPist-L14 and a commercial polyaryl piperidinium membrane PAP-TP-85 were utilized in the cell. In 1 cm2 1 1 cm AEM- WE device, this noble-metal-free cell only requires 1.79 V at 25 C and 1.59 V at 80 C to reach 1000 mA cm2 Fig. 3d.

It achieves 7570 mA cm2 at 2.0 V, showing a competitive performance with pre- viously reported noble-metal-free AEM-WE devices Table S4. The long-term durability of the Int-NiMoO2-assembled cell is demon- strated for 1000 h at a cell voltage of 1.7 V with a degradation rate of 3.96 µV h1 Fig. 3e. Moreover, the scale-up feasibility was evaluated using a 25 cm2 5 5 cm AEM-WE device Fig. S32. At 80 C, the Int-Ni MoO2-assembled cell delivers a high current of 85.67 A current den- sity of 3430 mA cm2 at 1.8 V, exceeding the United States Department of Energy DOE 2026 target of 3000 mA cm2 at 1.8 V for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis26. Notably, the voltage of the 25 cm2 electrolyser was 1.58 V at 1000 mA cm2, which is similar that of the 1 cm2 electrolyser 1.59 V. These results conﬁrm the good scal- ability of Int-NiMoO2-assembled cells for AEM-WE applications. The chemical stability of the electrode was evaluated by mon- itoring the dissolution of metal ions during electrocatalysis. As shown in Fig. 4a, compared with Ni, a signiﬁcantly higher amount of Mo was dissolved in both Int-NiMoO2 and NiMoMoO2. This is attributed to the strong interactions between MoO2 and alkali metals, which result in severe cathodic corrosion27,28. Additionally, the Int-NiMoO2 elec- trode showed better chemical stability than NiMoMoO2, as indicated by the smaller amount of dissolved Mo Fig. 4a, which is consistent with the XPS results Figs. S33 and S34. The NiMo atomic ratio on the exterior of the Int-NiMoO2 electrode after catalysis was similar to that in the initial stage before the HER Fig. 4b. However, the NiMo atomic ratio of the catalytic NiMoMoO2 electrode was higher than the initial ratio, owing to the dissolution of Mo. Furthermore, after catalysis, the NiMo atomic ratio within the interior of the NiMoMoO2 electrode was still higher than that of the initial electrode, implying that ion dissolution during catalysis was not restricted to the surface-active sites. Additionally, as shown in Fig. 4c, Int-NiMoMoO2 exhibits a sta- bility number S-number of 1.7 105, which is signiﬁcantly higher than that of NiMoMoO2 4.9 10429. Nanoindentation measurements of Int-NiMoO2 indicated a maximum indentation depth hmax of 2050 235 nm and a ﬁnal depth hf of 1277 389 nm under a load of 2 mN, both signiﬁcantly lower than the corresponding values of 2760 364 nm hmax and 2591 352 nm hf for NiMoMoO2 Fig. 4d and Fig. S35. This indicates that the hardness and compressive strength of the sharp blade-shaped Int-NiMoMoO2 with a dense interlayer are greater than those of the rod-like NiMoMoO2 without an interlayer. The nano-scratch measurements revealed that the critical binding forces of the catalyst layer on the substrate is 24.8 3.1 mN for Int-NiMoMoO2 Fig. S36a, which is higher than that of NiMoMoO2 13.6 3.1 mN.

As a result, Int-NiMoO2 maintains its structure and catalytic activity even when the current density reaches up to 6 A cm2. Gas contact angle measurements showed that the gas con- tact angle of Int-NiMoMoO2 was 147, which is greater than that of NiMoMoO2 124 and PtC 89. The low surface energy in Int-NiMo MoO2 at the gasliquid interface facilitated bubble detachment, pre- venting overpotential ﬂuctuations and releasing pressure shocks caused by bubble formation at ampere-scale current densities Fig. 3b. The faster bubble evolution kinetics for Int-NiMoO2 is con- ﬁrmed by its smaller adhesive force 51.50 1.09 µN, compared to 74.26 1.53 µN for NiMoMoO2 30 Fig. S36b. High-speed camera ima- ges revealed small dense bubbles on the surface of Int-NiMoO2 when a potential was applied Fig. 4f, g. However, unevenly distributed large bubbles were observed on NiMoMoO2 and PtC, as shown in both the top and side views. The average bubble diameter of 67.34 µm for the Int-NiMoO2 electrode, compared to 119.27 µm for NiMoMoO2 and 146.32 µm for PtC Figs. S37 and S38. Furthermore, no signiﬁcant bubbles remained on the surface of the Int-NiMoO2 electrode after the potential was removed Fig. S37, indicating the low adhesive force of the bubbles on this electrode. The images of bubble growth and detachment were captured by a high-speed camera Fig. S39. At 50 mA cm2, the average times for bubble detachment are 65 14 ms, 175 23 ms, and 457 163 ms for the Int-NiMoO2, NiMoMoO2, and Pt C electrodes, respectively Fig. S40. Therefore, the unique sharp blade-shaped structure and homostructural interlayer in Int-NiMo MoO2 enhanced its high mechanical stability and promoted smooth gas formation and detachment at ampere-scale current densities. In summary, an Int-NiMoO2 electrode with a homostructured interlayer was fabricated using a simple corrosion strategy. Int-Ni MoO2 exhibited signiﬁcantly improved mechanical stability with higher critical binding forces compared to NiMoMoO2 without an interlayer. Moreover, the large gas contact angle and sharp blade shape of the catalytic layer in Int-NiMoO2 allowed small bubbles to detach from the surface, enabling smooth mass transfer during intense electrocatalysis. Therefore, Int-NiMoO2 exhibited a low overpotential of 73.2 14.2 mV and long-term stability over 6000 h at 1000 mA cm2 in 1 M KOH. The Int-NiMoO2-assembled AEM-WE devices with areas of 1 cm2 and 25 cm2 further demonstrate their potential for industrialisation. Therefore, the corrosion and in situ growth strategies offer new methods to prepare ultrastable electrocatalysts with dense homostructural interlayers for HER and may inspire the synthesis of other electrocatalysts for various applications.

Int-NiMoO2 First, 1.00 g of NH46Mo7O24 4H2O, 0.10 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 0.10 g of NH4F were dissolved in 30 mL of deionised water to form a colourless solution. A pre-cleaned NF 1.5 2.5 cm was soaked in the colourless solution and shaken at 25 C for 2 h to form a white-green suspension. For the hydrothermal process, the suspension and NF were then transferred into a reactor and allowed to react at 150 C for 6 h. The NF was then washed with deionised water and EtOH and dried in a vacuum oven at 25 C for 12 h. The obtained precursor was then calcined at 500 C for 2 h in a H2Ar 5:95 atmosphere to yield the Int- NiMoO2. The loading masses of the catalyst and interlayer were 6.38 0.37 mg cm2 and 2.46 0.15 mg cm2, respectively. The pre- paration method of the interlayer on nickel foam INF was the same as that of Int-NiMoO2 but without the hydrothermal process. NiMoMoO2 22. A green-coloured solution was prepared by dissolving 0.44 g of NH46Mo7O24 4H2O and 0.42 g of NiNO32 6H2O in 30 mL of deionised water.

Scanning electron microscopy SEM was performed on a Zeiss Gemini 450 microscope system. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy HRTEM and energy-dispersive X-ray EDX analysis were carried out using a Thermo Fisher Talos F200X G2 system at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. An ESCALAB Xi analyser Thermo Fisher with Al radiation was employed for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS analysis, and the XPS depth proﬁling was performed using an Ar ion source. All XPS peaks were calibrated using the C 1 s line 284.8 eV as the stan- dard. Crystallographic data were collected on a Bruker D8 Venture diffractometer with Mo-Diamond Kα radiation λ 0.71073 Å at 300 K. Unit cell determination and data reduction were processed using the APEX3 programme. The crystal structure was solved and reﬁned by direct methods with SHELXT and SHELXL programs31,32. Load- displacement curves were obtained by nanoindentation measure- ments on a Nano Test Vantage with a maximum load of 2 mN. Nano- scratch measurement were carried out on the Nano Indenter G200X with maximum load of 50 mN and displacement of 200 µm. The cata- lyst growth on the nickel foil were used for the nano-scratch mea- surement. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ICP-MS, iCAP RQ was performed using a Thermo Fisher inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. A high-speed camera ACS-1 M60 was used to capture photos of bubble attachment over catalysts at 50 mA cm2. Fourier-transform infrared FTIR, Nicolet iS50 spectra were obtained using a Thermo Fisher FTIR microspectrometer. Ultra- sonic measurements were conducted using an ultrasonic cleaner KUDOS, SK2200H operating at frequencies of 53 and 35 kHz.

HgHgO calibrated to 0.930 V in 1 M KOH using a standard hydrogen electrode was used as the reference electrode, and graphite was used as the counter electrode. The working electrode was cut into an L-type shape with an immersion area of 1.0 1.0 cm during the test. The distance between the working and reference electrodes was maintained at 12 mm. Linear sweep voltammetry LSV measurements were performed at a scan rate of 5 mV s1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was tested at an open circuit voltage with an AC amplitude of 5 mV. Solu- tion resistances in 1 M KOH are 0.041 0.004, 0.052 0.009 and 0.089 0.005 Ω for Int-NiMoO2, NiMoMoO2, and PtC, respectively. In the multiple-current tests, online water injection was employed to maintain a constant KOH level. In the long-term durability test at 1000 mA cm2, the counter electrode was substituted with a nickel mesh due to the instability of graphite. The electrolyte temperature may be slightly higher than 25 C under high current densities. The degradation rate r was calculated as follows: r ηf ηi t ð1Þ where ηf is the ﬁnal overpotential or voltage V, ηi is the initial over- potential or voltage V, and t is the catalysis time h. The 1 cm2 and 25 cm2 AEM-WEs were measured in 1 M KOH on the Autolab PGSTAT302 with 20 A booster and Solartron Analytical with 100 A booster workstation, respectively. NiFe-based anode CAPist- L1 and commercial polyaryl piperidinium membrane PAP-TP-85 were utilized in the cell. The membrane was soaked in 1 M KOH for 6 h before used. LSV measurements were performed at a scan rate of 10 mV s1. The stability tests were measured at 1000 mA cm2 with the online water injection to maintain a constant KOH level. Turnover frequency TOF The TOF was calculated using the following equation33,34: TOF j NA 2 F ðnMo nNiÞ ð2Þ where j is the current A, NA is the Avogadros constant, F is the Faraday constant, and nMo nNi represents the total number of reac- tive sites. nMo and nNi were determined based on the XPS results, assuming that the metal atoms on the surface are the active centres and are all accessible to the electrolyte. Accelerated stress testing Accelerated stress testing was carried out by square-wave cycles between a low current density of 0 mA cm2 and a high current density of 1000 mA cm2. The current density was held for 2 s per cycle. LSV measurements were performed every 5000 cycles.

While the oxidation of methylarenes represents an ideal route to aromatic aldehydes due to the availability of starting materials, existing methods face significant challenges, including reliance on hazardous oxidants, costly catalysts, poor scalability, and limited compatibility with electron-deficient substrates. To address these limitations, we report a practical and scalable electrochemical method for the oxidation of electron-deficient methylarenes to access aromatic aldehydes, eliminating the need for chemical oxidants or homogeneous transition-metal catalysts. This approach operates under industrially viable conditionshigh current densities 75 mA cm², minimal electrolyte loading 0.05 equiv, and operation in an undivided cell without additivesto produce aromatic acetals, which are readily hydrolyzed to the corresponding aldehydes. The use of minimal electrolyte not only reduces costs and simplifies product isolation but also significantly enhances anodic oxidation selectivity, ensuring high efficiency and practicality. This protocol exhibits a broad substrate scope, compatibility with both batch and continuous flow systems, and exceptional scalability, as demonstrated by successful 10.1002anie.202504612 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

Traditional methods for methylarene oxidation rely heavily on stoichiometric oxidants such as chromium, cerium, or hypervalent iodine reagents, raising significant environmental and safety concerns.2-4 Catalytic approaches, while more sustainable, often require expensive metal complexes as catalysts, along with hazardous oxidants like Selectfluor, K₂S₂O₈, or peroxides.5-7 Aerobic oxidation strategies, though promising, are hindered by issues such as overoxidation to carboxylic acids, poor reactivity with electron-deficient substrates, and the complexities of oxygen management at scale.8- 11 Consequently, industry continues to rely on indirect halogenation-oxidationhydrolysis sequences,1, 12-15 which involve hazardous reagents and often yield undesirable mixed halogenation products.14 Electrochemistry has emerged as a sustainable synthetic tool that replaces chemical redox reagents with traceless electrons16-29 and have been applied to the oxygenation of alkylarenes.30-34 Notably, the electrooxidation of electron-rich toluene derivatives has been successfully implemented in the industrial production of p-anisaldehyde and 4-tert-butylbenzaldehyde Fig. 1a.35 However, extending this methodology to electron-deficient methylarenes has proven challenging due to their 10.1002anie.202504612 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

Our method employs industrially relevant conditionshigh current densities 75 mA cm² in undivided cells, minimal electrolyte loading 0.05 equiv, and an additive-free environmentto achieve selective benzylic oxidation without the need for homogeneous metal catalysts or hazardous reagents. The protocol demonstrates broad substrate tolerance, accommodating sterically hindered and poly-substituted methylarenes. Scalability is demonstrated through batch reactions at 100 g and kilogram scales, as well as continuous flow processes. Central to the success of this electrochemical approach is the use of low electrolyte concentrations to enhance the selectivity of anodic oxidation and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol TFE as a solvent, which resists oxidative decomposition and minimizes undesired aromatic ring substitution. The electrochemical oxidation of 2-methylbenzonitrile 1 was selected as a model reaction to establish optimal conditions Fig. 2a. Under industrially relevant current densities 75 mA cm² in an undivided cell, the desired acetal 2 was obtained in 72 yield using trifluoroethanol TFE as the solvent and a minimal electrolyte loading 0.05 equiv of nBu₄NOTf. Subsequent treatment of the post-electrolysis mixture with aqueous HCl furnished benzaldehyde 3 in 67 yield. Notably, the high current density ensures scalability and productivity, while the low electrolyte concentration minimizes costs, simplifies product isolation, and facilitates solvent recyclingcritical advantages for industrial adoption. Counterintuitively, increasing the electrolyte concentration significantly reduced the yield of 2 Fig. 2b. Similarly, elevating the current density to 100 mA cm² marginally decreased the yield 10.1002anie.202504612 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

Solvent screening revealed that methanol or ethanol entries 34 completely suppressed acetal product formation due to competitive solvent oxidation. Among anode materials, platinum outperformed carbon-based electrodes entries 56, which rapidly passivated due to the high oxidation potential of the methylarene 1. Notably, Pt-coated titanium PtTi can be used as a cost-effective alternative vide infra.

Meta- and para-substituted toluenes e.g., 4 11 were successfully oxidized, though nitro-substituted substrates e.g., 12 failed, likely due to competitive cathodic nitro group reduction. Di- and tri-substituted derivatives, including sterically demanding 2,6-dichlorotoluene 29 and highly electron-deficient analogs bearing dual cyano 39 or ester 46 groups, were also viable. Remarkably, substrates with two methyl groups underwent selective mono-oxidation 5254 or, upon application of a higher charge, full oxidation to bisaldehydes 5561, the latter of which remains challenging for conventional methods due to overoxidation. Some substrates, particularly those less electron-deficient than the model nitrile substrate 1, experienced unwanted substitution at the benzene ring. However, these issues were mitigated using nBu4NOTs as the electrolyte. The more basic tosylate likely facilitated benzylic deprotonation, steering the reaction towards benzylic functionalization rather than benzene ring substitution. By contrast, heteroaromatic substrates such as methylated pyridines and pyrimidine did not afford the desired products, indicating a limitation of the current method for electron-deficient heteroarenes see Figure S6 in the Supporting Information for details. Successful scale-up was demonstrated through both batch and continuous flow methodologies. In batch mode, the 100 g-scale oxidation of 62 using PtTi anodes designed to minimize platinum usage afforded aldehyde 36 in 73 isolated yield Fig. 4a, maintaining fidelity with small-scale performance 76 yield, thereby validating process robustness. Notably, direct kilogram-scale electrolysis of 63 under identical conditions delivered aldehyde 11 in 71 yield without requiring parameter reoptimization Fig. 4b, underscoring exceptional translational consistency.

The reaction time for kilogram production could be shortened by increasing the electrode surface area while maintaining a constant current density. For continuous processing, a six-hour operation of compound 64 oxidation was achieved by implementing a modular system of 20 parallel microreactors, producing 34.9 g of aldehyde 14 66 yield, Fig. 4c. This continuous-flow electrochemical reactor configuration, arranged in parallel, was selected to avoid the engineering challenges associated with direct geometric scale-up, such as elevated ohmic resistance and impaired mass and heat transfer, thereby maintaining optimal electrochemical performance and enabling higher efficiency for large- scale electrochemical synthesis. This electrochemical platform eliminates dependence on toxic stoichiometric oxidants e.g., NBS and peroxide and silver-containing reagents mandated by prior protocols,42, 43 while sustaining efficiency across scales. In addition, the TFE solvent used in this process was readily recovered by simple distillation. For the process shown in Fig. 4a, 88 of the TFE was recovered by simple distillation. The electrolysis of compound 1 with recovered TFE afforded compound 2 in 71 yield under standard conditions without any reduction in electrochemical efficiency. 10.1002anie.202504612 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

Reaction monitoring revealed that methylarene 1 first converted to ether intermediate 65, which subsequently transformed into acetal 2 Fig. 5a. At low electrolyte concentrations 0.05 equiv of nBu₄NOTf, 2 accumulated as 1 and 65 were consumed. Conversely, high electrolyte loading 1 equiv led to oxidative decomposition of 2, likely due to reduced selectivity between oxidation of 165 and 2. Cyclic voltammetry suggested that 2 oxidizes at a slightly higher potential than 65 See Supporting the Information for details. Since redox potentials are influenced by electrolyte concentration, this potential gap likely widens under dilute conditions, providing a plausible explanation for the enhanced selectivity observed at lower electrolyte concentrations. 10.1002anie.202504612 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

This stark contrast supports an electron transfer- driven mechanism for the electrochemical process, distinct from the radical-based pathway of thermal bromination. Building on these findings, we propose a stepwise mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation of methylarenes Fig. 5d. Initial single-electron transfer at the anode generates an arene radical cation intermediate I, which undergoes sequential proton and electron transfer to form a benzylic carbocation II. Nucleophilic trapping of II by TFE solvent yields the benzyl ether intermediate III. A subsequent oxidation cycleinvolving analogous electron transfer, protonelectron transfer, and TFE additionconverts III to the final acetal product. Compared to MeOH, TFE is more resistant to oxidative decomposition and less nucleophilic. The use of TFE as the solvent ensures selective oxidation of the electron-deficient methylarene substrates and minimizes unwanted solvent trapping of the arene radical cation intermediates. In summary, we developed a scalable, electrochemical method for oxidizing electron-deficient methylarenes to access benzaldehydes under industrially viable conditions. Key featureslow electrolyte loading, additive-free operation, high current density, and compatibility with batchflow systemsaddress longstanding challenges in aromatic aldehyde synthesis. This work bridges a critical gap in sustainable aromatic aldehyde synthesis, offering a robust, industrially adaptable solution that circumvents longstanding practical limitations in selectivity, safety, and scalability. 10.1002anie.202504612 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

Herein, we present the mechanistic insight underlying the electrochemical synthesis of deprotonated anion of H2O2 HO2 via 2eoxygen reduction by ultrathin Ni-benzenedicarboxylic acid NiBDC, guided by its thickness-dependent performance and pH-induced reconstruction behavior. The real active species are identiﬁed as alkaline- reconstructed β-NiOH2 that is chemically coupled with 1,4-benzenedi- carboxylic acid residual ligand. The hybrid catalyst is characterized to exhibit an optimized surface electronic structure, which improves the intrinsic activity and selectivity. Operando characterization and theoretical simulations further reveal that the residual ligand functionalization signiﬁcantly boosts the for- mation and facilitates the adequate binding of OOH intermediates. Thus, the ligand-functionalized NiOH2 exhibits high HO2 selectivity 90 in 0.1 M KOH across a broad current density up to 200 mA cm2. Moreover, high HO2 production rate of 13.7 mol gcat 1 h1 with signiﬁcant accumulation of 2.0 wt. HO2 under alkaline conditions is achieved at 200 mA cm2 over 100 h, sug- gesting the promising potential for large-scale electrosynthesis of HO2 in industrial applications. Hydrogen peroxide H2O2 ﬁnds widespread applications across var- ious industries, including textile bleaching, pharmaceuticals, waste- water treatment, chemicals, energy carriers, and semiconductor manufacturing, with a current market value of around 3.5 billion USD, growing at a 5 compound annual growth rate. Therefore, the devel- opment of green, efﬁcient, and economically viable methods for H2O2 production is of great signiﬁcance13. Currently, the predominant production of H2O2 relies on the traditional anthraquinone method46, however, it is constrained by environmental concerns, complex pro- cesses, intensive energy consumption, hazardous materials usage, and the necessity of stabilizers during transportation7,8. The renewable energy-powered electrochemical oxygen reduction ORR via the two- electron 2e transfer pathway offers a green, efﬁcient and economic approach for distributed on-demandon-site H2O2 generation, thereby signiﬁcantly mitigating expenses and risks associated with transportation and storage911. Especially, the 2eORR under an alka- line environment exhibits enhanced catalytic activity and optimized selectivity towards the deprotonated anion of H2O2 HO2 due to the pH effect on the catalytic process and ORR mechanism12. It is worth noting that HO2 is particularly suitable for applications where the Received: 10 July 2024 Accepted: 26 May 2025 Check for updates 1State Key Laboratory of Chemical Resource Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, China. 2Hong Kong Quantum AI Lab, AIRInnoHK of Hong Kong Government, Hong Kong SAR 999077, China. 3Faculty of Maritime and Transportation, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, China. 4College of Materials Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310014, China. 5Department of Chemistry, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR 999077, China. 6These authors contributed equally: Tianyu Zhang, Weibo Wang. e-mail: zxguohku.hk; ljfmail.buct.edu.cn Nature Communications 2025 16:5240 1 1234567890:,; 1234567890:,; separation of peroxide from alkaline is unnecessary13.

For example, biomass valorization and pulp bleaching require both high pH 11.6 and high concentration 1 wt. of peroxide14,15. Metal-organic frameworks MOFs are widely recognized as pro- mising electrodes for electrochemical H2O2 generation, owing to their exceptional features, such as large speciﬁc surface area, adjustable porosities, periodic active sites, and composition diversity16,17. How- ever, their electrocatalytic performance is usually thickness- dependent due to their limited electrical conductivity, restricted mass permeability, and active centers blocked by the organic ligands or residual solvents. Therefore, the development of ultrathin 2D MOFs, with maximized exposure of unsaturated metal sites and enhanced masselectron transport, is highly desirable18,19. Nonetheless, potential in-situ reconstructions of the electrocatalysts, especially for MOFs with weak coordination bonds between metal nodes and organic linkers, hinder the identiﬁcation of intrinsic catalytic species and the mechanistic investigation of key effects2024. Additionally, the water hydrolysis of MOFs under the alkaline environment is also non- negligible25. This aspect is often ignored and overshadowed by the initial charging current spike, leading to a misleading declaration of stable MOF electrocatalyst based solely on the minimal performance difference observed during long-term test26,27. Although the recon- struction phenomenon in FeCoNi based-MOFs for alkaline oxygen evolutions, including partial28 and complete29 reconstruction, has gained widespread recognition, its investigation in 2e- ORR is rarely explored30. Herein, we focused on the 2e- ORR of Ni3OH2BDC2H2O4 NiBDC, where BDC represents 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate for HO2 - production. The choice of a Ni-based MOF was based on its advanta- geous features, including tunable electronic structure, moderate binding afﬁnity for oxygen intermediates, and stability in alkaline conditions31. By optimizing the dissolution-reprecipitation rate during the transformation of NiOH2 precursors, we successfully obtained NiBDC with a wide range of thicknesses, including ultrathin utn-, 6 nm, thin tn-, 24 nm, thick tk-, 90 nm, and bulk b-, 120 nm NiBDC. The as-prepared NiBDC exhibits thickness-dependent 2e- ORR performance with thinner layers demonstrating better performance. Combined with in-situ and ex-situ characterizations, we revealed that the surface partially reconstructed BDC-functionalized NiOH2 derived from utn-NiBDC is the real active species for 2e- ORR. More- over, operando Raman and ATR-FTIR spectra, along with theoretical simulations, identiﬁed different rate-determining steps RDS between utn-NiBDC and ultrathin NiOH2, indicating the signiﬁcant impact of the residual BDC functionalization on boosting the proton-involved steps and providing appropriate binding for the OOH intermediate, thereby ensuring enhanced 2e- ORR performance. As a result, the utn- NiBDC exhibits promising 2e- ORR performance at an industrial cur- rent density of 200 mA cm-2 and a high HO2 - production rate of 13.7 mol gcat -1 h-1 with 92 HO2 - selectivity in a ﬂow cell, with stability maintained over 100 h. The HO2 - concentration accumulated after 6 h reached 2.0 wt., which is sufﬁcient to meet the requirements for biomass valorization. Results and discussion Synthesis of utn-NiBDC",

The HO2 - concentration accumulated after 6 h reached 2.0 wt., which is sufﬁcient to meet the requirements for biomass valorization. Results and discussion Synthesis of utn-NiBDC and its 2eORR performance The synthesis of utn-NiBDC was achieved by using NiOH2 Supple- mentary Fig. 1 as Ni source in a mixed solution of water and dime- thylformamide Fig. 1a. By precisely adjusting the dissolution and reprecipitation rates through facile regulation of the solution ratio between water and dimethylformamide, NiBDC with varying thick- nesses could be readily obtained. The key to the synthesis of ultrathin NiBDC lies in the utilization of a low percentage of water, which effectively retards the leaching of Ni2 ions by suppressing the release rate of protons from BDC, an organic ligand known for its weak acidic nature. Thus, the corresponding low local Ni2 concentration leads to a speciﬁc crystal orientation growth, favoring the formation of utn- NiBDC32. Transmission electron microscopy TEM images show clearly NiBDC morphological variation with thickness ranging from ultrathin Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 2a, thin Fig. 1c, thick Fig. 1d, and bulk Supplementary Fig. 3a nanoribbons, demonstrat- ing that the growth direction of the MOF was restricted with the rational control on Ni2 releasing rate. The thickness of utn-, tn-, tk-, and b-NiBDC are conﬁrmed as 6, 24, 90, and 120 nm, respectively, as revealed by the atomic force microscopy AFM Fig. 1eg and Supplementary Fig. 3b. The number of layers for utn-NiBDC is about 7 based on the crystal structure33. Moreover, the powder X-ray dif- fractometer XRD patterns Supplementary Fig. 2b of all three NiBDC samples agree well with the standard Ni3OH2BDC2H2O42H2O JCPDS card No. 35-1677, conﬁrming their single-crystalline nature. The peak intensity ratio between the 100101 plane reduces, and the characteristic peaks broaden as the thickness of NiBDC decreases, demonstrating successful regulation of the crystal growth orientation of NiBDC through our strategy. The electrocatalytic 2e- ORR of the NiBDC with different thick- nesses was examined in O2-saturated KOH 0.1 M using a rotating ring- disk electrode RRDE with a collection efﬁciency of 0.424 Supple- mentary Fig. 4. All NiBDC samples follow preferentially 2e- ORR reaction pathway Fig. 1h, while utn-NiBDC shows a relatively high ring current with optimized HO2 - selectivity of 90 Fig. 1i, higher than that of tn- 77, tk- 68, and b-NiBDC 67. The 2e- Tafel slope of utn-NiBDC 118 mV dec-1 is lower than those of other NiBDC samples, indicating its faster reaction kinetics Supplementary Fig. 5. The cor- responding electrons transferred number n and Faradaic efﬁciency FE during the reaction are further calculated Supplementary Fig. 6a, suggesting a clear thickness-dependent 2e- ORR performance relationship Supplementary Fig. 6b.

The utn-NiBDC exhibits the lar- gest electrochemical surface area ECSA, further verifying the suc- cessful thickness manipulation of NiBDC Supplementary Fig. 7. More importantly, the activity and selectivity of utn-NiBDC are well main- tained after both 10k cycles accelerated degradation test in RRDE Fig. 1j and 7 h on-site H-type cell chronoamperometry test Supple- mentary Fig. 8, indicating good electrocatalytic stability of utn-NiBDC. Investigation on the reconstruction of utn-NiBDC Although the utn-NiBDC exhibits promising stability, the electro- catalytic performance stability of the MOFs does not guarantee their chemical stability, hindering the identiﬁcation of active species. Spe- ciﬁcally for Ni-based materials, Ni-MOF34, oxygen vacancy Ov enri- ched NiO35, NiOH2 36 and β-NiOOH37 are all reported as active species for 2e- ORR. The chronoamperometry curve of utn-NiBDC exhibits a pronounced response at 0.2 V, characterized by a remarkable initial surge within the ﬁrst 15 s followed by a sustained plateau Supple- mentary Fig. 9, validating a rapid activation process38. After recon- struction, the selectivity of utn-NiBDC initially increases and then stabilizes during the detachment of residual BDC ligand, indicating the existence of an optimal surface BDC ratio. To investigate the possible reconstruction phenomenon and its corresponding mechanism, we characterized the post-reacted utn-NiBDC after a spe- ciﬁc reaction time PR-utn-NiBDC. TEM images revealed defect-rich morphologies of PR-utn-NiBDC with no discernible changes in thickness Supplementary Fig. 10, indicating the occurrence of NiBDC recon- struction during the reaction. As shown in Fig. 2a, complete structure transformation from MOF into β-NiOH2 can be observed in XRD pat- terns of PR-utn-NiBDC after a reaction time of 1 h in 0.1 M KOH. It is worth noting that the reconstruction occurs in all NiBDC with different thicknesses Supplementary Fig. 11, demonstrating that the above- measured performance of NiBDC reﬂects the properties of the recon- structed catalysts. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 11d, utn-NiBDC exhibits the lowest charge transfer resistance, indicating the enhanced ORR performance of ultrathin catalysts may originate from the more Article https:doi.org10.1038s41467-025-60467-0 Nature Communications 2025 16:5240 2 Fig. 1 Thickness-performance relationship. a Schematic illustration for ultrathin NiBDC fabrication. bd TEM images and eg AFM images inset is the corre- sponding height proﬁle measured along the dashed line of b, e utn-NiBDC, c, f tn- NiBDC, and d, g tk-NiBDC. h Polarization curves of Ni-based MOF catalysts recor- ded at 1600 rpm and a scan rate of 5 mV s-1, together with the detected HO2 - cur- rents on the ring electrode upper panel at a ﬁxed potential of 1.2 V vs. RHE 100 iR-corrected.

Extended reaction time further conﬁrms β-NiOH2 as the ﬁnal and real active species. Moreover, the reconstruction receded as the pH of electrolytes decreased Fig. 2b, with the activity and selec- tivity dropping rapidly Supplementary Fig. 12a, b. Even after a 12 h chronoamperometry test at 0.2 V, the XRD pattern of PR-utn-NiBDC at pH 9 agrees well with the MOF crystalline Supplementary Fig. 12c, verifying that the reconstruction mechanism in 2e- ORR potential region 0.8 to 0.2 V vs. RHE is pH-dependent. This observation agrees with the fact that oxidation potentials of Ni2Ni3 are approximately 1.3 V vs. RHE42, thereby excluding the possibility of NiOOH as active sites within this speciﬁc potential range 0.8 to 0.2 V vs. RHE. To further investigate the pH-induced reconstruction mechanism, we directly treated utn- NiBDC at 0.1 M KOH utn-NiBDCKOH. Time-dependent XRD patterns Fig. 2c demonstrate that utn-NiBDC undergoes reconstruction upon electrolyte contact, as evidenced by the reduction of MOF peaks within 1 min and a transformation from amorphous to crystalline β-NiOH2 over time. Notably, utn-NiBDCKOH 1 min shows no obvious increase in current in the chronoamperometry test, further conﬁrming the pH- induced reconstruction mechanism. Moreover, the reconstructed PR- utn-NiBDC exhibits a higher ring current than utn-NiBDC in 0.1 M PBS, demonstrating the effectiveness of the reconstruction strategy Sup- plementary Fig. 13. Inspired by the fact that catalyst reconstruction primarily involves the ligand replacement from BDC to OH in Ni coordination, the BDC ligand behaviors during the alkaline-induced reconstruction were explored. Given the signiﬁcant sensitivity of the C, H, and O elements in the BDC ligand to environmental inﬂuences, precisely quantifying its detachment behavior presents a challenge. Consequently, we employed a Cl-substituted BDC-based utn-NiBDC Cl-utn-NiBDC for a detailed investigation. As shown in Fig. 2df, elemental mapping of Cl- utn-NiBDC before and after KOH treatment illustrates the persistent presence of Cl, 1.0 at. after 1 h, and 0.5 at. even after a prolonged time of 12 h, indicating the existence of residual BDC ligand after Fig. 2 MOF in-situ reconstruction. a Time-dependent XRD patterns of PR-utn- NiBDC. b pH-dependent XRD patterns of PR-utn-NiBDC. c Time-dependent XRD patterns of utn-NiBDC in 0.1 M KOH.

The presence of BDC ligand was further conﬁrmed through organic elemental analysis, which revealed the existence of chlorine in the Cl-utn-NiBDC after KOH treatment for 1 h and 12 h with content of 3.5 and 2.1 wt., respectively Supplementary Table 1. Moreover, both the utn-NiBDC following KOH treatment and 2e- ORR for 1 h show two new peaks at449 and 1050 cm1 in Raman spectra Fig. 2g, corresponding to the A1gT translational mode and 2nd-order lattice mode of reconstructed Ni-OH43. Meanwhile, the in- and out-of- phase stretching modes of the coordinated carboxylate groups bond with metal centers located at 1618, 1444 cm1 and C-H region of the benzene rings in BDC ligands located at 1139, 865, and 623 cm1 indicate the reconstructed NiOH2 is residual BDC-functionalized44. Similar results are also observed in the Fourier-transform infrared FT- IR spectra Fig. 2h. The remaining peaks at 1383 and 1582 cm-1 suggest the residual BDC, while the new peak at 3650 cm-1 demonstrates the formation of NiOH2 45. The valence state of utn-NiBDC under various treatments was further conﬁrmed by XPS Supplementary Fig. 14. Notably, PR-utn-NiBDC exhibits relatively low Ni binding energy compared to utn-NiBDC and utn-NiBDCKOH, suggesting a reduced valent state of Ni species after 2e- ORR process Fig. 2i. Additionally, no obvious oxidization on Ni can be observed on additional H2O2 without applied voltage utn-NiBDCKOH H2O2 and PR-utn-NiBDC with applied voltage without H2O2 generation injecting N2 instead of O2, excluding the in-situ oxidization of Ni by the interfacial peroxide Supplementary Fig. 15.Based on the above analysis, the active species after reconstruction is identiﬁed as the residual BDC-functionalized ultrathin NiOH2. Identiﬁcation of the role of BDC-functionalization To pinpoint the actual active species and assess the residual BDC role in reconstructed utn-NiBDC during 2e- ORR, an ultrathin NiOH2 utn- NiOH2 nanosheet of similar thickness 7.8 nm to utn-NiBDC 6 nm was obtained for compare Supplementary Fig. 16. X-ray absorption ﬁne structure XAFS spectroscopy46 was performed to investigate the coordination environment and electronic structure of utn-NiBDC, PR- utn-NiBDC, and utn-NiOH2. The Ni K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure XANES spectra of the above samples, along with the refer- ences of Ni foil and NiO, show clearly the electronicvalence structures for Ni Fig. 3a. It is noted that the Ni K-edge XANES spectra of the as- prepared samples exhibit NiO-like features. The inset in Fig. 3a high- lights the pre-edge features of Ni K-edge XANES spectra, in which the risen edge of the PR-utn-NiBDC is slightly lower than those of utn- NiBDC and utn-NiOH2, clearly indicating the unique electronic structure of the Ni with residual BDC functionalization and H2O2 reduction. Fourier-transformed FT k3-weighted extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure EXAFS spectra were employed to further analyze the coordination environment of the samples.

Figure 3b illus- trates that the peak area of PR-utn-NiBDC at 1.6 Å associated with Ni-O path is signiﬁcantly smaller than that of utn-NiBDC and utn-Ni OH2, demonstrating a lower oxygen coordination number. This observation aligns with the wavelet transform Supplementary Fig. 17. Quantitative least-square EXAFS curve-ﬁtting parameters Supplementary Fig. 1822 and Supplementary Table 2 reveal a reduced oxygen coordination number in PR-utn-NiBDC about 5.85 compared to utn-NiBDC 5.99 and utn-NiOH2 6.21, implying that a single carboxyl group of the residual BDC is coordinated with the Ni. Additionally, the inﬂuence of existing Ov is eliminated by consistent electron paramagnetic reso- nance EPR spectra between PR-utn-NiBDC and utn-NiOH2 Fig. 3c. Beneﬁting from the unique residual BDC ligand coordination structure, utn-NiBDC exhibits a higher ring current than that of utn- NiOH2 and conductive agent XC-72 Fig. 3d. Calculations of HO2 - selectivity, electron transfer number and corresponding FE demon- strate that NiOH2 coordinated with a residual BDC ligand favors the 2e- pathway Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 23a. The 2e- Tafel slope of utn- NiBDC 118 mV dec-1 is lower than that of utn-NiOH2 125 mV dec-1, while the 4e- Tafel slope displays an opposite trend, suggesting the crucial role of the residual BDC ligand in selective regulation Supple- mentary Fig. 23b, c. The ECSA of utn-NiBDC 37.3 cmECSA 2 is higher than utn-NiOH2 4.5 cmECSA 2, endowing utn-NiBDC with increased O2 adsorption capacity Supplementary Fig. 2447. As shown in Supple- mentary Fig. 25, the dramatic drop in disk current after adding thio- cyanate ions SCN conﬁrms that the Ni species are the active sites toward 2eORR48. Moreover, the possible active species of NiOH2 with intentionally added BDC and NiO were excluded by testing the coun- terparts Supplementary Fig. 26. Exploration of the mechanism The catalytic activity and selectivity of 2e- reduction of O2 to HO2 - at pH11.6 are associated with the binding energy of the key reaction intermediate OOH49. For catalysts with weak OOH adsorption, O2 activation Eq. 1 is the rate-limiting step RDS, while for those with strong OOH binding, OOH desorption Eq. 2 becomes the RDS. O2 H2O e ! OOH OH ð1Þ OOH e ! HO 2 pH 11:6 ð Þ ð2Þ It is necessary to avoid excessively strong OOH adsorption, as this favors O-O bond dissociation, leading to the predominant 4e- pathway. Operando Raman spectroscopy was performed spanning 0.8 to 0.2 V vs. RHE to probe the OOH intermediate during the 2e- ORR. A pronounced Raman band at approximately 732 cm-1 appeared at 0.7 V Fig. 3f, attributed to the O-O stretching vibration from OOH bridge- to-bridge adsorption structure on the electrocatalyst surface50, indi- cating the OOH desorption as the RDS.

Conversely, utn-NiOH2 dis- plays no evident new peak upon potential decreases Fig. 3g, suggesting O2 activation as the RDS. Furthermore, operando atte- nuated total reﬂectance FT-IR ATR-FTIR spectroscopy was per- formed for in-depth mechanistic insight. As shown in Fig. 3h, a major peak at 1258 cm-1 and a weak peak at 1647 cm-1, attributable to the O-O stretching mode of the surface-adsorbed OOH and H2O species51, respectively, emerged and increased with decreasing potential applied on utn-NiBDC. Here, we are unable to distinguish whether the surface- adsorbed OOH species originate from the OOH intermediate or the physically adsorbed HO2 - products. However, utn-NiBDC exhibited a much stronger intensity of OOH species than utn-NiOH2, implying that the introduced BDC ligand in the asymmetrical Ni active sites played a dominant role in promoting proton-involved steps to ensure a rapid formation of the key OOH intermediate, thus accelerating the whole kinetics of the 2e- ORR electrolysis. Moreover, a negative peak at around 1468 cm-1 is assigned to the adsorbed O2 species, demon- strating that the lack of active surface-adsorbed oxygen is a critical factor limiting the reaction kinetics in utn-NiOH2 Fig. 3i52. Supple- mentary Fig. 27 illustrates that utn-NiBDC exhibits relatively low charge-transfer and mass-transfer resistances compared to utn- NiOH2 under kinetic-relative regions in operando electrochemical impendence spectra EIS53. The narrower half-width of the char- acteristic peak in Bode plots for utn-NiBDC, relative to utn-NiOH2, signiﬁes accelerated electron transfer and enhanced surface reaction kinetics for OOH intermediates34. To clarify further the mechanistic insight, ﬁrst-principles simula- tions were also performed to rationalize the residual BDC ligand and Ov effect on ultrathin NiOH2 for alkaline 2e- ORR. The computational models for pure NiOH2 p-NiOH2, NiOH2 with Ov Ov-NiOH2, NiOH2 with residual BDC ligand functionalization BDC-NiOH2, and NiOH2 with both OV and BDC Ov-BDC-NiOH2 were built based on the EXAFS ﬁtting results Supplementary Fig. 2831 and Supplemen- tary Data 1. As shown in Fig. 4ad and Supplementary Fig. 32, Article https:doi.org10.1038s41467-025-60467-0 Nature Communications 2025 16:5240 5 signiﬁcant charge redistributions were observed at the Ni-OOH bonding regions, which is likely the origin of the enhanced alkaline 2e- ORR performance. As shown in Supplementary Table 3, the Bader charge transfer between Ni and adsorbed OOH for p-NiOH2 is only 0.09 e, suggesting that the primary interaction is hydrogen bonding rather than coordination. Upon introducing the BDC ligand and oxy- gen vacancies to disrupt the symmetry of NiOH2, the Bader charge transfer increases, indicating the adsorption mode changes from hydrogen bonding to ionic bonding. BDC-NiOH2 exhibits the largest Bader charge transfer of 0.79 e, indicating a strong interaction between Ni and OOH species. Moreover, BDC-NiOH2 exhibits a d-band center closer to the Fermi level -4.06 eV compared to those of Ov-NiOH2 -4.279 eV and Ov-BDC-NiOH2 -4.465 eV, suggesting the optimal alignment of Ni and OOH near the Fermi level in BDC- NiOH2 Supplementary Fig. 33.

Moreover, BDC-NiOH2 exhibits a d-band center closer to the Fermi level -4.06 eV compared to those of Ov-NiOH2 -4.279 eV and Ov-BDC-NiOH2 -4.465 eV, suggesting the optimal alignment of Ni and OOH near the Fermi level in BDC- NiOH2 Supplementary Fig. 33. Recent research highlights that the 2e- ORR efﬁcacy is closely linked to the moderate binding strength of OOH intermediate54. Figure 4e depicts the free energy diagram for the alkaline 2e- ORR pathway at an equilibrium potential of 0.7 V vs. RHE. The free energy difference of OOH for BDC-NiOH2 compared to the ideal value of 3.52 eV is 0.09 eV, which is less than that of p-NiOH2 1.19 eV, Ov-NiOH2 0.83 eV and Ov-BDC-NiOH2 0.64 eV, indi- cating the optimized OOH binding energy after the introduction of residual BDC ligand. Moreover, stepwise reaction barriers for 2e- ORR were analyzed, focusing on O2 activation and OOH desorption. Fig- ure 4f illustrates that the RDS for s-NiOH2 and Ov-NiOH2 is O2 activation, but with the introduction of the BDC ligand, it shifts to OOH desorption, corroborating the operando measurements. Upon considering H2O2 as the ﬁnal product instead of HO2 -, BDC-NiOH2 demonstrates the lowest efﬁciency in 2e- ORR, signifying that utn- NiBDC is uniquely suited for alkaline 2e- ORR processes Supplemen- tary Fig. 34. Moreover, the free energy difference of BDC-NiOH2 between OOH and HO2 - is -1.24 eV, which is lower than that of OOH and O with -0.19 eV, indicating that 2e- ORR process is more favorable Fig. 3g. This free energy difference can be attributed to the idea that Fig. 3 BDC-functionalized active species. a XANES spectra of utn-NiBDC, PR-utn- NiBDC, and utn-NiOH2 at Ni K-edge. b Corresponding FT-EXAFS spectra. c EPR spectra of PR-utn-NiBDC and utn-NiOH2. d Polarization curves of utn-NiBDC, utn- NiOH2, and XC-72 recorded at 1600 rpm and a scan rate of 5 mV s-1, together with the detected HO2 - currents on the ring electrode upper panel at a ﬁxed potential of 1.2 V vs. RHE 100 iR-corrected.

High-rate HO2 electrochemical production A three-compartment ﬂow cell Supplementary Fig. 35 was constructed to evaluate the 2eORR performance and applicability of the utn-NiBDC electrocatalyst towards industrially applied current densities. The utn- NiBDC exhibited signiﬁcantly higher current density than that of utn- NiOH2 Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 36. Notably, 130 mV is saved in utn-NiBDC compared with utn-NiOH2 at the same applied current density of 200 mA cm-2. The HO2 - FE of utn-NiBDC over a range of cur- rent densities from 25 to 200 mA cm-2 remains around 90, surpassing the FE of approximately 40 for utn-NiOH2 Fig. 5b. Beneﬁted from the unique role of the BDC ligand and in-situ reduction by the generated HO2 -, utn-NiBDC achieved high HO2 - production rate of 13.7 mol gcat 1 h1, signiﬁcantly greater than utn-NiOH2 and the state-of-the-art 2eORR- to- HO2 electrocatalyst reported to date Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 37. Moreover, a prolonged stability test for utn-NiBDC at a current density of 200 mA cm-2 shows good durability over 100 h without evi- dent degradation Fig. 5d, highlighting the chemical robustness of the residual BDC ligand functionalized catalyst Supplementary Figs. 3840. Such a device produces HO2 - with a high concentration of 2.0 wt. within 6 h and is maintained stably and continuously in alkaline conditions Fig. 5e. Increasing or decreasing the solution pH cannot yield a higher concentration of HO2 -, due to the trade-off between selectivity and decomposition rate Supplementary Fig. 41. Discussion In summary, we present NiBDC MOF with different thicknesses as highly active alkaline 2eORR electrochemical pre-catalysts prepared by a facile dissolution-reprecipitation procedure. Utn-NiBDC with a thickness of 6 nm exhibits the highest HO2 - electrosynthesis activity among the NiBDC, demonstrating a thickness-performance relation- ship. The real active species is identiﬁed as the residual BDC ligand functionalized ultrathin NiOH2 originated from pH-induced recon- struction, conﬁrmed by the ex-situ XRD patterns and Cl labeling experiment. Moreover, operando characterizations and DFT calcula- tions suggest the introduction of a BDC ligand on NiOH2 can tune the OOH adsorption energies and boost the proton-involved steps. Finally, utn-NiBDC was also evaluated in a ﬂow cell-based alkaline electrolyzer at industrially current density, long stability of 100 h, high FE of 90 and production rate of 13.7 mol gcat 1 h1 was obtained, demonstrating its promising application for hydrogen peroxide pro- duction. Overall, our work highlights the reconstruction of MOF during the 2eORR process. Both the synthetic strategy and the residual ligand effect reported here can guide future MOF pre-catalyst design with improved performance for large-scale hydrogen peroxide production.

The acquired EXAFS data were processed according to the standard procedures using the ATHENA module implemented in the IFEFFIT software packages55. The k3-weighted EXAFS spectra were obtained by subtracting the post-edge background from the overall absorption and then normalizing it to the edge-jump step. Subsequently, k3-weighted χk data of Fe K-edge were Fourier transformed to real R space using a Hanning window dk 1.0 Å-1 to separate the EXAFS contributions from different coor- dination shells. To obtain the quantitative structural parameters around central atoms, the least-squares curve parameter ﬁtting was performed using the ARTEMIS module of the IFEFFIT software packages. The following EXAFS equation was used: χ k ð Þ X j NjS2 0F k ð Þ j kR2 j exp 2k2σ2 j h i exp 2Rj λ k ð Þ sin 2kRj ϕ k ð Þ j h i where S0 2 is the amplitude reduction factor; Fjk is the effective curved-wave backscattering amplitude; Nj is the number of neighbors in the jth atomic shell; Rj is the distance between the X-ray absorbing central atom and the atoms in the jth atomic shell backscatter; λk is the mean free path in Å; ϕjk is the phase shift including the phase shift for each shell and the total central atom phase shift; σj is the Debye-Waller parameter of the jth atomic shell variation of distances around the average Rj56. The functions Fjk, λk, and ϕjk were calculated with the ab initio code FEFF8.057. For Wavelet Transform WT analysis, the χk exported from Athena was imported into the Hama Fortran code58,59. The parameters were used as: R range, 1-4 Å, k range, 0-13 Å-1; k weight: 3; Morlet function with κ 10, σ 1 was used as the mother wavelet to provide the overall distribution.

The Si prism surfaces were polished with diamond suspension, ultrasonically cleaned, and treated with piranha solution. Gold deposition involved immersing prisms in a gold-plating solution NaAuCl42H2O, Na2SO3, Na2S2O35H2O, NH4Cl, and hydroﬂuoric acid at 60 C. After a double gold deposition process, with the second lasting 90 s, the prisms were rinsed, dried, and coated with 30 μL of ink on the gold ﬁlm working electrode. The ink-coated prisms were then assembled in a homemade spectro-electrochemical cell, with AgAgCl as the reference electrode, introduced via a Luggin capillary, and a Pt mesh as the counter electrode. The chronoamperometry method was employed to apply different voltages to the electrode with 100 mV intervals in the range of 0.8 to 0.2 V vs. RHE. All spectra were presented as 4R R ES ER ER where ES and ER representing the sample and reference spectra, respectively. Electrochemical RRDE measurements The catalytic ink was prepared by dispersing 4 mg of catalyst and 2 mg of carbon black Vulcan XC72 in 980 μL of iso-propanol and 20 μL of 5 wt. Naﬁon solution. After sonication for 2 h, 3.14 μL of catalyst suspension was drop-dried onto the disk electrode to form a uniform catalyst layer the catalyst loading was 0.1 mg cm-2. The electro- chemical measurements including linear sweep voltammetry LSV, cyclic voltammetry CV, and electrochemical impedance spectro- scopy EIS were determined in a standard four-electrode rotation ring disk electrode RRDE system RRDE-3A, Japan ALS controlled with a CHI or Donghua electrochemical workstation at room temperature 25 C. The Pt ring id 5 mm, od 7 mm and glass carbon disk d 4 mm RRDE loaded with catalyst, graphite electrode, and satu- rated calomel electrode SCE was used as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively. Before elec- trochemical measurements, the reference electrode was calibrated by immersing it in a saturated KCl standard solution and ensuring that the recorded potential corresponded to the theoretical value at room temperature. EIS tests were carried out at the open circuit potential of the electrode with a frequency range of 0.1 to 106Hz and an amplitude of 5 mV, and ZView software was used for EIS data-ﬁtting. All potentials were corrected to the reversible hydrogen electrode RHE by ERHE ESCE 0.224 0.059 pH. Unless speciﬁed, all curves were cor- rected by 100 iR-compensation as determined by EIS. All the elec- trochemical tests were performed in N2O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH, which is immediately used after preparation. The pH value of 0.1 M KOH is determined as 13 0.1 using a pH meter.

A potential of 1.2 V vs. RHE was applied to the ring of the working electrode during the entire testing process to detect the H2O2. The Tafel slope was calculated using E b logj j0, where E is the potential, b is the Tafel slope, j is the disk current density, and j0 is the exchange current density. The electrochemical surface area ECSA of the electrocatalysts is mea- sured using a non-Faradaic potential window between 0.76 and 0.82 V vs. RHE, while the double-layer capacitance is determined by plotting the current density change at 0.8 V against the scan rate. The ECSA is calculated using ECSA CdlCs, with Cs being the speciﬁc capacitance of a ﬂat electrode, set at 0.04 mF cm-2 for NiOH2 60. Based on the current of both disc and ring electrodes, HO2 - selectivity, electrons transferred number n, and HO2 - Faradaic efﬁciency FE of the cata- lysts on RRDE were calculated by the following equations: HO 2 ð Þ 200 ir N id ir N n 4 id id ir N FE HO 2 ð Þ ir N id 100 FE OH ð Þ 1 FE HO 2 ð Þ where id is the disk current; ir is the ring current; N is the collection efﬁciency 0.424 after calibration.

The working electrode was a 1 cm2 carbon paper TGP-H-060, Japan Toray with 0.25 mg of catalyst pipetted. Graphite electrode and SCE were utilized as the counter and reference electrode, respectively. The electrolyte samples were taken, neutralized, and then titrated against Ce4 e.g., 2Ce4 H2O2 2Ce3 2H O2. The amount of H2O2 generated can be calculated as twice the molar amount of Ce4 consumed. To determine the concentration of Ce4, the absorbance of the solution was mea- sured at 319 nm Supplementary Fig. 8.

The electrolyte was used immediately after preparation. The electrolyte was 10 mL 0.1 M KOH in both cathode and anode compartments with a continuous circulation 5 mL min-1 by a peristaltic pump, which is immediately used after preparation. All the tests were under room temperature 25 C. Simultaneously, a continuous ﬂow of O2 or air was introduced into the cell 40 mL min-1. The H2O2 production amount in the electrolyte was quantiﬁed using the Ce4 titration method. The H2O2 faradaic efﬁciency was calculated through the same method of H-type Cell measurement. Theoretical computation Density functional theory DFT calculations were performed to investigate the geometric and electronic structures of residual BDC ligand functionalized, oxygen vacancies induced, or pristine NiOH2 and the mechanism for 2e- ORR by using the Vienna Ab initio Simula- tion package VASP6163. The projected augmented wave PAW potential and generalized gradient approximation GGA of the spin- polarized Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof PBE functional were employed to describe the electron-ion interaction and exchange-correlation energy, respectively6466.

The Hubbard U DFT U corrections67,68 for 3 d transition metal were set using a U-J value of 6.45 eV for Ni atom69. The DFT-D3 empirical correction method was adopted to describe the van der Waals interactions between the adsorbed atoms and the support70. The construction of the surface model was based on the single crystal of NiOH2 by constructing a 2 2 1 or 2 2 2 supercell. The primitive cell model of NiOH2 was constructed with fully optimized atomic position, cell volume, and cell shape. The vacuum spacing in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the catalyst was at 15 Å. Then, an oxygen vacancy or a BDC ligand was added into the NiOH2 to construct Ov-NiOH2 and BDC-NiOH2, respectively. The slab models were only optimized for the atomic positions. The equilibrium lattice constants were optimized with maximum stress on each atom within 0.05 eV Å-1 under the quasi-Newton algorithm71,72. The initial magnetic moments of Ni atoms were set to be 2 μB, while the spin-polarization effect was also considered.

After geometry optimization, the lattice constants of NiOH2 supercell with 100 atoms are a 12.63 Å, b 12.63 Å, and c 31.25 Å, which should be sufﬁcient. Thus, the Brillouin zone integration was performed using 3 3 1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point sampling for all samples74. The associated Gibbs free energies ΔG of the adsorbates for each electrochemical process are calculated as: ΔG ΔE ΔEZPE TΔS Where the value of ΔE, ΔEZPE, ΔS, and T denotes the changes of DFT energy, the zero-point energy, the entropy, and the temperature, respectively. The calculated energy value of HO2 - is from the NIST National Institute of Standards and Technology Chemistry WebBook, SRD 69. Speciﬁcally, the reactions and energy are calculated based on the computational hydrogen electrode CHE model. The half reaction O2 2 H e H2O2 is analyzed using the CHE model to obtain the energy of H e, which is referenced to ½ H2. Referring to H2O and H2, the energy of diatomic oxygen molecules O2 is obtained as 4.92 eV, and the energy of hydrogen peroxide H2O2 is obtained as 3.67 eV. Thus, the energy of the deprotonated anion of H2O2 HO2 - is calculated as 2.356 eV.

However, this route is now limited by the unsatisﬁed efﬁciency and short durability, which origi- nates from a kinetic disparity between water dissociation WD and proton- coupled electron transfer on existing catalysts. Herein, we harness the exceptional WD capability of the intermetallic electride IE materials for the electrocatalytic methanization from CO2. Combinative experimental and the- oretical approaches strongly evidence a spontaneous WD on an IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 catalyst due to its unique electronic structure strongly modiﬁed charge states, reversible lattice hydride ions and anionic electrons. Conse- quently, this catalyst exhibits improved methanization performance in alkaline ﬂow cells, achieving a methane Faraday efﬁciency of 72 at 1.21 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode vs. RHE and peak partial current density of 476.7 mA cm2 at 1.52 V vs. RHE. Energetic calculations further establish the mechanistic link between WD and methanization processes on our catalyst, on which a lowered free energy barrier for the key CO to CHO transformation step is observed. This work sheds light on the pivotal role of WD and expands the repertoire of materials for efﬁcient electrocatalytic methanization from CO2. The renewable-electricity-powered electrochemical CO2 reduction CO2RR to methane is an appealing pathway to regenerate natural gas from carbon emissions13. Aiming to industrializing this pathway, vast efforts have been devoted to designing more efﬁcient Cu-based cata- lysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability47. Such catalyst design was mainly guided by the classic descriptor-based approach, in which the outcome of a catalyst is depicted by its binding strengthens to carbonaceous intermediates. For CO2RR, the binding energy of adsorbed carbon monoxide COad serves as a common and simple descriptor due to the universal scaling relation among all Received: 4 September 2024 Accepted: 21 May 2025 Check for updates 1College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, P.

In particular, promoting WD on a catalyst enhances the methanization because 1 CO2RR necessi- tates molecular water as hydrogen source15, 2 methane is a deeply hydrogenated product and involves the transfer of eight electrons and six hydrogens16, 3 The hydrogenation of COad to CHxOad x 1, 2, 3 is widely recognized as the rate-determining step along the methaniza- tion pathway17,18. Established knowledge from the alkaline water electro- catalysis indicates the hydroxyl-favoring materials, e.g., metal hydroxide or oxides, could promote the rate of WD in alkaline neutral environments19,20. Levering this knowledge, previous stu- dies have designed electrocatalytic interfaces between CO2-active Cu-based components and hydroxyl-favoring components for CO2RR. Indeed, a positive link between the electrosynthesis of methane and WD was found and rationalized21. Though the effectiveness of these heterojunction approaches for methaniza- tion, the intrinsically multiphase catalysts encountered challenge of structural stability and thus performance sustainability during CO2RR2225. In particular, metal hydroxides or oxides are apt to be reduced under negative bias and the co-presence of H2 bypro- duct from CO2RR. This then desires a single-phase metallic alternative to the aforementioned multiphase catalysts for syn- chronizing WD and CO2 activation. Recently, on an emerging class of IE materials, we observed spontaneous WD when studying water-induced structural evolution26,27. Distinct from conven- tional alloys, IEs consist of transition metals with strongly mod- iﬁed charge states, reversible lattice hydride ions and anionic electrons, which facilitate the dissociation of small molecules, including H2O27, N2 28 and CO2 29 et al. This inspired us to design IE- based catalysts with balanced WD and CO2 activation. In this work, we applied IE-based nanomaterials for CO2RR and reported a class of IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 catalyst for the electrochemical methanization. After verifying the structural features of IE using var- ious characterizations, we systematically probed the WD behaviors of this IE catalyst using H2O-temperature-programmed surface reaction and energetic calculations, which conﬁrmed a spontaneous WD on this IE surface. When tested in an alkaline ﬂow cell, the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 catalyst showed a methane Faradaic efﬁciency FE of 72 at a reduc- tion potential of 1.21 V vs. RHE, along with a partial current density of 476.7 mA cm2 at 1.52 V vs. RHE. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy observed that, compared to the Cu control, the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 catalyst showed a strengthened atop-adsorbed CO and a lowered ratio of free and weakly hydrogen-bonded water. DFT calcu- lations further showed the methanization pathway to be energetically more favorable on the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 catalyst.

A selected-area electron diffraction pat- tern inset conﬁrms the presence of the respective 101, 201, 210 plane of IE LaCu0.67Si1.33, which aligns perfectly with the XRD results.

The unit cell of IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 was meticulously constructed using density functional theory DFT calculations, synergistically enhanced by self-built machine learning-accelerated structural predictions27,32. This analysis reveals that La atomic layers are sand- wiched between two-dimensional honeycomb planes formed by Cu and Si atoms, with an interlaminar distance of approximately 2.15 Å Fig. 1e. Prior studies have postulated the presence of anionic elec- trons nestled within the interstitial spaces between the CuSi and La layers, thus lending credence to its nomination as electride33. Further corroborating this, Bader charge analysis of as-constructed IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 model underscores that Cu and Si atoms act as electron acceptors from La atoms, as evidenced by their respective charge states Fig. 1e, La: 1.14 e ; Cu: 0.77 e ; Si: 0.47 e . To gain deeper insights, we experimentally delved into the electronic structure of the synthesized IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 material. The Cu LMM spectrum conﬁrms Cu maintains its metallic state in the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 sample Supplementary Fig. 4.

This observation is further reinforced by the Cu K-edge spectra of X-ray absorption near-edge structure XANES analysis, which displays a lower absorption threshold position and reduced intensity of the white-line peak for IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 material compared to Cu foil Fig. 1g3436. The Fourier-transformed k2-weighted extended X-ray absorption ﬁne-structure EXAFS spectrum displayed a weak peak around 2.2 Å Fig. 1h. Combined with the EXAFS spectrum ﬁtting results, the average Cu-Cu coordination number CN in IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 is 1.53, signiﬁcantly lower than that of Cu foil Supple- mentary Fig. 5 and Table S1. Having established the characteristic electride properties of IE LaCu0.67Si1.33, we move on to explore its behaviors towards WD. WD on IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 First, we used DFT calculations to project energetics of WD on the constructed IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 model Supplementary Fig. 6. Strikingly, our ﬁndings indicate a substantially lower stepwise barrier for the dissociation of H2O into H OH on the 101 surface of IE LaCu0.67Si1.33, which is the most exposed surface, at 0.33 eV, compared to the Cu111 surface, which exhibits a barrier of 1.19 eV. Furthermore, this dissociation pathway was found to be more exergonic on the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33101 surface 1.33 eV, relative to the Cu111 control 0.29 eV. These theoretical insights, from both thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives, strongly suggest that WD is preferentially facili- tated on the surface of IE LaCu0.67Si1.33, even with the inclusion of solvation energies. Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 7. To support the above calculations, H2O-temperature- programmed surface reaction TPSR tests were further carried out to track WD on various catalysts. Notably, on IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 sample, we ﬁrst observed a desorption peak at around 84 C mz 18, which can be ascribed to the release of physically adsorbed H2O molecules mz 18, Fig. 2b. Subsequently, we observed peaks corresponding to the desorption of H2 mz 2 at about 340 and 540 C. Given that water is the sole source for the adsorbed hydrogen in our test, the above observations indicate that, on the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 surface, WD occurred below 84 C at which temperature the molecular H2O des- orbs from the surface. We also conducted TPSR tests on other con- trol catalysts, including commercial Cu nanoparticles, home-made La3Cu2 and CuSi2 nanoparticles, and found both have a H2O deso- rption temperature close to 80 C Fig. 2b, Supplementary Figs. 810. Strikingly, we did not observe any peaks corresponding to H2 desorption on these materials within the 25600 C range tested, aligning with typical TPSR outcomes for conventional Cu- based alloys37. In addition, a prominent inelastic scattering back- ground was observed on IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 in the neutron diffraction pattern based on elastic scattering, which is closely related to the presence of hydrogen-containing structure after dehydration treat- ment Supplementary. 11. In short, combined results from TPSR tests, neutron diffraction pattern and energetic calculations enable us to conclude an exceptional WD capability of the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 catalyst, potentially stemming from",

Notably, the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 catalyst distinguished itself from the commercial Cu nanoparticles by predominantly producing methane across all investigated current densities, ranging from 100 to 900 mA cm2. Speciﬁcally, it reached a peak Faraday efﬁciency FE of 72 at 1.21 V vs. RHE, corresponding to a partial current density jCH4 of 429.7 mA cm2 Fig. 3a. Furthermore, a high jCH4 of 476.7 mA cm2 was achieved at 1.52 V vs. RHE Fig. 3b, highlighting the exceptional performance of the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 catalyst.

Within the whole potential region, the total FE of C1 product on the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 cat- alyst is higher than that on commercial Cu nanoparticles, which can be ascribed to a lower paired-Cu-site proportion on the former surface for C C coupling, as evidenced by the ﬁtting results from XAS analy- sis Fig. 3c. To further inspect the correlation between the IE characteristic and CH4 selectivity, we crafted a LaCu0.67Si1.33 control sample, which exhibited relatively inferior crystallinity denoted as IC LaCu0.67Si1.33 than the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 sample. This was experimentally achieved by reducing the cycles of electric arc-melting while maintaining the same feeding ratio of La, Cu, and Si elements. In the XRD pattern of IC LaCu0.67Si1.33, the diffraction peaks observed were consistent with of the main diffraction peaks of IE LaCu0.67Si1.33, but some stray peaks were also observed Supplementary Fig. 15.

Next, H2O-TPSR analysis was performed on the IC LaCu0.67Si1.33 sample to probe its response to WD. The IC LaCu0.67Si1.33 sample exhibited a water desorption peak mz 18 at 75 C and two H2 desorption peak mz 2 at 266 and 384 C. Comparative integration of the H2 desorption peaks between the two samples revealed a 1.56-fold increase in peak area for IE LaCu0.67Si1.33, underscoring the pivotal role of the unique IE feature in enhancing WD on the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 catalyst Supplementary Fig. 17. It is worth noting that both the IC LaCu0.67Si1.33 and IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 samples were obtained by ball milling and exhibited comparable speciﬁc surface areas, thereby negating the inﬂuence of surface area effects Supplementary Fig. 18 and Table S2. Notably, there are marked discrepancies in atomic conﬁgurations of active sites between IC and IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 surfaces. The disordered atomic arrangement in the IC model likely disrupts the anionic electron characteristics inherent in the crystalline lattice. This structural dis- tortion results in diminished electron transfer capacity to adsorbed CO species, as evidenced by the reduced electron transfer 1.23 e compared to the IE surface 1.70 e . Consequently, the IC surface exhibits signiﬁcantly weaker CO adsorption strength, with an adsorption energy of 1.49 eV versus 2.27 eV for the IE surface, highlighting the critical relationship between the IE characteristics and catalytic performance Supplementary Fig. 19. Applying the IC LaCu0.67Si1.33 catalyst for CO2 electrolysis, we found a lower FE of methane than IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 across the whole investigated current densities Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 20. Consequently, the above structural and electrochemical results strongly suggest a correlation between the IE features, facilitated WD and enhanced CH4 selectivity on the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 catalyst. By comparing with prior representative methanization catalysts and home-made La3Cu2 and CuSi2 nanoparticles in ﬂow cell setups under alkaline electrolyte, our IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 catalyst demonstrated signiﬁcant advancements in both selectivity and partial current density Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 2123. We also conducted an initial evaluation of structural stability of this new material as methanization electrocatalyst by operating the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 cat- alyst in a ﬂow cell for a continuous 10-h electrolysis at 100 mA cm2. Throughout this duration, both the applied potential and the selec- tivity of CH4 remained stable, with minimal ﬂuctuations observed Fig. 3f. From the respective STEM images and XRD patterns of IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 catalyst before and after CO2 electrolysis, we observed negligible variations in either morphology or crystallinity, indicative of its structural integrity throughout the electrolysis process Sup- plementary Fig. 24.

Article https:doi.org10.1038s41467-025-60353-9 Nature Communications 2025 16:5039 4 Mechanistic studies In literature, the energetics of CO has been widely used to project the electrocatalytic outcomes of CO2 into various mono-carbon or multi- carbon products39. Speciﬁcally, for the methanation of CO2, CO undergoes an additional six hydrogenation steps, necessitating a robust methanization catalyst with substantial CO binding energy to hinder its undesirable desorption as a byproduct. Therefore, we initi- ated our mechanistic investigations by comparing the adsorption energies of CO on the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 and Cu surfaces using DFT calculations. CO has a signiﬁcantly more negative adsorption energy on IE LaCu0.67Si1.33101 than on Cu111 2.27 vs. 1.02 eV, indicative of a more stable adsorption of CO on the former Fig. 4a. To validate these theoretical predictions, we employed low temperature CO-TPD experiments, which corroborated our DFT results by demonstrating that the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 catalyst exhibits a higher CO desorption temperature than Cu nanoparticles 220 vs. 180 K. Moreover, the larger CO desorption peak area on the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 surface, which is 2.6 times that of Cu nanoparticles, underscores the higher coverage of CO on the former Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 25. We further performed in situ attenuated total reﬂectance surface- enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy ATR-SEIRAS to probe the adsorption characteristics of CO during the reaction. On the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33, we observed a distinct signal in the range of 20382002 cm1, attributed to linearly atop-adsorbed CO COatop. However, on the control Cu nanoparticles, in situ ATR-SEIRAS shows two prominent peaks for COatop at 20402010 cm1 and bridge-adsorbed CO CObridge at 18971855 cm1, respectively40. Fig. 4c, d. Notably, the peak associated with the COatop on Cu nanoparticles displays a blue- shift compared with that on the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33. This shift can be explained by the back-donation of electrons from the metal Cu atoms on the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 surface, which enhances the ﬁlling of the 2π orbital",

    "text": "d. Notably, the peak associated with the COatop on Cu nanoparticles displays a blue- shift compared with that on the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33. This shift can be explained by the back-donation of electrons from the metal Cu atoms on the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 surface, which enhances the ﬁlling of the 2π orbital of the CO molecule with electrons. This observation suggests the increased electronegativity of Cu atoms on the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 surface, aligning with our calculations. The IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 exhibits a signiﬁcantly higher COatop peak intensity compared to pure Cu across the entire potential window studied that can be attributed to the substantial difference in CO consumption between C2 and C1 product formation pathways where C2 production requires approximately twice the amount of CO compared to C1 products. Additionally, the presence of a second set of peaks on pure Cu nanoparticles at 18971855 cm1 corresponds to CObridge on adjacent Cu sites which related to the coupling behavior of CO. The absence of such CObridge on the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 aligns with its tendency to favor C1 products and reinforces our EXAFS ﬁndings that this catalyst exhibits signiﬁcantly lower Cu-Cu coordination numbers compared to pure Cu nanoparticles. Recent evidence veriﬁed the pivotal role of interfacial water in the electrocatalysis of HER and CO2RR41, which prompts us to investigate the interfacial water structures close to the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 and Cu nanoparticles using ATR-SEIRAS. Our spectroscopic results revealed a broad vibrational band corresponding to VO H stretching, span- ning 3700 to 3000 cm1 on both catalysts. This band is typically ascribed to diverse O H stretching modes of water, encompassing signals from free water H2O F, strongly hydrogen-bonded water H2O S, and weakly hydrogen-bonded water H2O W, as corrobo- rated by previous literature Supplementary Fig. 264244. Notably, as the potential increased, the proportions of H2O F and H2O W peaks on both IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 and Cu decreased, concurrent with the Stark effect. In principle, H2O F and H2O W are energetically easier to be dissociated for hydrogenation compared to H2O S. It is therefore reasonable to deduce that a catalyst with strong water-dissociation capabilities should manifest a lower ratio of H2O F and H2O W peaks, as these species are expected to be consumed rapidly. Con- sistent with this rationale, the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 catalyst exhibited a notably lower ratio of H2O F and H2O W peakareas compared to the control Cu nanoparticles, highlighting the superior water-dissociation 150 200 250 300 350 400 stin u . b r a ytis n e t n I Temperature K IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 Cu 5E-10 0.00 0.02 0.04 4000 3800 3600 3400 3200 3000 2800 0.00 0.02 0.04 H2O-S H2O-W H2O-F Fitting Raw e c n a b r o s b A stin u . b r a Wavenumber cm-1 0.00 0.02 0.04 4000 3800 3600 3400 3200 3000 2800 0.00 0.02 0.04 H2O-S H2O-W H2O-F Fitting Raw -0.1 V stin u . b r a e c n a b r o s b A Wavenumber cm-1 a b",

To quantify this difference, we compared the integration of the adsorp- tion peaks at 0.1 V and 1.9 V, and found that the consumption of H2O F and H2O W peaks on IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 was approximately three times that on Cu nanoparticles, further conﬁrming the excep- tional WD capability of the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 catalyst Supplemen- tary Fig. 28. To theoretically rationalize the high CH4 selectivity of IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 catalyst, we carried out DFT calculations to investigate the methanogenesis pathways. After the adsorption of CO, the energy levels of CO protonation and C C coupling determine the branching of C1 e.g., CH4, CH3OH vs. C2 e.g., C2H4, C2H5OH products. There- fore, we ﬁrst compared the changes of Gibbs free energy for CO pro- tonation and C C coupling pathways Fig. 5a. We found that the C C coupling on the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33101 surface is signiﬁcantly energeti- cally unfavorable compared to its protonation 0.68 vs. 0.66 eV, and CO undergoes hydrogenation with a preference to form CHO rather than COH 0.66 vs. 1.18 eV, even with a contribution of solvation Supplementary Fig. 29. In contrast, although the protonation of CO to CHO is also energetically preferred on the Cu111 surface, there is a small difference in energy between CO protonation and C C coupling 0.82 vs. 1.32 eV. These calculated results are consistent with our ATR- SEIRAS observations. The charge density distributions were analyzed for both IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 and Cu surfaces with adsorbed CHO by comparing the electron charge donationacceptance status Fig. 5b. After the adsorption of CHO, the donation of electron charge can be observed on both IE LaCu0.67Si1.33101 and Cu111 surfaces, and the electron charge is accumulated between CHO and surfaces. However, the electron density of the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33101 surface, which is composed of transition metals with strongly changed charge states and anionic electrons, is stronger than that of Cu111. Speciﬁcally, the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 surface has more electrons that can be transferred to CHO than the Cu surface 1.74 vs. 0.39 e",

Speciﬁcally, the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 surface has more electrons that can be transferred to CHO than the Cu surface 1.74 vs. 0.39 e , which explains why the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 surface can adsorb the key intermediate CHO more stable than the Cu surface 4.25 vs. 1.51 eV to efﬁciently promote the CH4 selectivity. Figure 5c further provides the Gibbs free energy diagram for converting CO2 to CH4 on the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 surface through the CHO intermediate and possible hydrogenation routes according to previous literature45. The adsorption conﬁgurations of the related intermediates are given in Supplementary Fig. 30. The formation of COOH and CHO are exergonic on the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 surface 2.1 and 1.33 eV but endergonic on the Cu surface 0.15 and 0.15 eV, which contributes to the higher CH4 selectivity of IE LaCu0.67Si1.33. The further hydrogenation products of CHO can be CH2O or CHOH. By comparing the Gibbs free energies of these two pathways, we found that the hydrogenation of CHO to CH2O is more favored. The con- secutive hydrogenation of the C end of CH2O is strong exergonic, forming CH4. The effect of solvation energies on reaction free energies was benchmarked, proving that calculated results capture the correct trends Supplementary Figs. 31, 32. We proposed that the CO2-to-CH4 conversion on the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 surface follows: CO2 COOH CO CHO CH2O CH3O CH4 Supplementary Figs. 33, 34. Discussion In summary, we have reported a class of IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 catalyst with spontaneous WD for enhanced electrosynthesis of methane from CO2 reduction. Based on a series of physical characterizations and theo- retical projections, we have unveiled the distinct electronic structures of IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 catalyst. The behaviors of WD on various catalysts were systematically investigated employing both experimental and calculational means, the results of which underscore a signiﬁcantly enhanced WD on IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 over other control catalysts, including pure Cu and typical solid-solution alloys.

The coupling of in situ spectroscopies and DFT calculations pained an energetically favorable reaction pathway for the CO2-to-CH4 conversion on the IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 surface. This work demonstrates the spontaneous WD capability of IE materials as a promising catalyst platform for the electrochemical methanization of CO2 and potentially other H2O-involved renewable conversions.

All chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further puriﬁcation. Synthesis of IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 catalyst The IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 sample was synthesized through arc-melting stoichiometric ratios of La, Cu, and Si ingots in a water-cooled copper furnace under puriﬁed argon atmosphere about 5 bar. To ensure phase purity, the arc-melting process was repeated eight times with intermediate ﬂipping of the ingot. The resulting bulk material was manually ground into coarse powder using an agate mortar, followed by high-energy ball milling at 200 rpm for 20 h employing a ball-to- powder mass ratio of 20: 1 to achieve nanoparticle reﬁnement. Wet milling with water was utilized during this size reduction process. Synthesis of IC LaCu0.67Si1.33, La3Cu2 and CuSi2 catalysts The IC LaCu0.67Si1.33 was prepared following identical procedures but with a single arc-melting cycle. Similarly, La3Cu2 and CuSi2 were syn- thesized using equivalent methodology, where respective elemental combinations La Cu or Cu Si were arc-melted in stoichiometric proportions under identical reactor conditions. Characterizations X-ray diffraction XRD patterns were obtained on a Bruker D2 Advance powder diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation λ 1.54178 Å at 30 kV and 10 mA.

The He ﬂow was maintained at room temperature for 30 min to eliminate any excess H2O. Finally, TPSR measurements were conducted from 30 C to 600 C under helium at a heating rate of 10 C min1. For low-temperature CO-TPD, the sample was heated to 600 C and held for 2 h in Ar atmosphere, followed by a switch to He gas at the same temperature for additional 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the sample was further reduced to 150 K using liquid nitrogen circulation, and the carrier gas was switched back to the 5 CO-He mixture. Once the baseline sta- bilized, the data curve was recorded during heating from 150 K to 400 K at a rate of 20 K min1. Powder neutron data were collected on the Multi-physics instrument at China Spallation Neutron Source CSNS, Dongguan, China. Before testing, the sample IE LaCu0.67Si1.33 underwent a three-stage treatment process: First, it was thermally annealed at 600 C for 2 h under continuous argon ﬂow. Following cooling to ambient temperature, the atmosphere was switched to a water vapor-saturated argon ﬂow maintained for 1 h. Finally, the system was purged with pure argon and subjected to a secondary thermal treatment at 300 C for 2 h to complete the processing. The sample ca. 2 g was loaded in vanadium alloy cans in the glove box. Then the powder neutron data were conducted by multiple bank detectors at room temperature. Preparation of gas diffusion electrodes A catalyst ink was prepared by ultrasonicating 8 mg of catalyst powder with 20 μL of Naﬁon solution 5 wt. in 1 mL ethanol for 1 h to achieve homogeneous dispersion. This ink was then uniformly spray- coated onto the microporous carbon layer of a 4 4 cm2 carbon paper substrate Sigracet 28BC using an airbrush system.

The catalyst loading was controlled at approximately 0.35 mg cm2, as determined by gravimetric analysis of the substrate before and after coating. The coated electrode was trimmed to expose a 1 1 cm2 active area of catalytic layer. Finally, the prepared GDE was air-dried under ambient conditions for 12 h prior to electrochemical testing. Electrochemical measurements The CO2RR performance was evaluated at room temperature 25 2 C and pressure 1.01 105Pa using a ﬂow cell system, in which the anode and cathode chambers were separated by an ion-conducting anion exchange membrane Fumasep FAA-3-PK-130. An electro- chemical workstation Autolab PGSTAT204 was conﬁgured as a three- electrode system with a constant current source. Anion exchange membrane 2.5 2.5 cm2 was soaked in 1 M KOH for 48 h and rinsed with deionized water before use. The catalyst loaded GDE served as the working electrode, while an AgAgCl electrode with saturated KCl as the ﬁlling solution and nickel foam were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. All potentials in this experiment were calibrated to the potential relative to the reversible hydrogen elec- trode RHE based on the following equation after IR compensation: Eðvs: RHEÞ Eðvs: AgAgClÞ 0:197 0:059 pH 0:8 iR The 80 iR compensation was performed for the electrolysis experiment at each potential, with the ohmic resistance determined through extrapolation of the high-frequency intercept in electro- chemical impedance spectra. The AgAgCl reference electrode potential was calibrated against the reversible hydrogen electrode RHE, Phychemi Co., Ltd. in 1 M KOH electrolyte, yielding a stable value of 1.00 0.01 V vs. RHE. The electrochemical measurements employed a freshly prepared 1 M KOH electrolyte pH 13.7 0.2 that Article https:doi.org10.1038s41467-025-60353-9 Nature Communications 2025 16:5039 7 was utilized within 72 h of preparation. The electrolyte was stored in PTFE containers under ambient temperature conditions 25 2 C between experimental sessions. For each electrolysis experiment, 10 mL electrolyte were dispensed into both the cathodic and anodic chambers of the ﬂow cell system, each featuring a 1 cm3 working volume. Continuous electrolyte circulation was maintained through both electrode compartments using a peristaltic pump operating at a constant ﬂow rate of 10 mL min¹. The high-purity CO2 99.99 gas supply ﬂow rate was regulated by a mass ﬂow meter and passed through the gas chamber of the ﬂow cell at a ﬂow rate of 20 sccm.

The acquired EXAFS data were processed according to the standard procedures using the Athena and Artemis software, parts of the Demeter package. Preprocessing of data included alignment, edge calibration, deglitching, normalization, background subtraction, and conversion of data into a chi ﬁle for data ﬁtting; all this was done with Athena; EXAFS of the Cu was ﬁtted to obtain the amplitude reduction factor S0 2. Theoretical calculations All calculations were performed using density functional theory DFT with the projectoraugmented wave PAW46,47 methodand the Perdew- Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation GGA-PBE48, as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package VASP49,50.

Herein, we found that hydrophilic ILs can enrich trace C2H2 in an ethylene-rich stream and create an acetylene-rich microenvironment for Cu nanoparticle Cu NP active sites. Increasing the solubility of C2H2 at the three-phase interface can effectively improve the activity of the electrochemical acetylene selective hydrogenation reaction EASR. The full conversion of trace C2H2 molecules in the ethylene-rich stream effectively solves the problem of preparing polymer-grade ethylene in industrial production. However, too high solubility of C2H2 at the three-phase interface will also lead to the formation of C4 byproducts. The relationship between C2H4 selectivity and KC2H4KC2H2 is a volcano-shaped curve, which provides valuable descriptors. Finally, the BmimClCu catalysts achieved a C2H2 concentration as low as 0 ppm in the product, with selectivity over 90 in 125 h of long-term evaluation under the ethylene-rich stream. KEYWORDS: ionic liquids, three-phase interface, solubility, electrochemical acetylene selective hydrogenation, nonprecious metal catalysts 1. INTRODUCTION The catalytic process of multiphase electrocatalytic reactions involves gas dissolution, solute diffusion, electrolyte circulation, product desorption, and reaction kinetics on the catalysts surface, which is a complex process.13 The three-phase interface, as the main reaction site, includes solid catalysts, liquid electrolytes, and gaseous reactants.46 The changes in its reaction microenvironment directly affect key issues such as mass transfer, electron conduction, and the coordination environment of catalytic active sites.7,8 Therefore, the micro- environment of the three-phase interface plays a vital role in electrochemical performance.912 However, for heterogeneous catalytic reactions involving gases, the dissolution and diffusion in microenvironments are easily overlooked by researchers.13 In particular, the reaction gases that are difficult to dissolve in the electrolyte participate in the reaction N2, C2H2, C2H4.14,15 Therefore, this work focuses on the physicochem- ical properties of the catalytic reaction microenvironment and strives to establish the structureactivity relationship between the regulation of the three-phase interface microenvironment and catalytic activity. In recent years, the electrochemical method for removing C2H2 impurities from crude C2H4 has proven to be a feasible solution.1620 Compared with traditional methods, the EASR has the characteristics of low energy consumption and low cost, which has attracted widespread attention.2123 However, industrial production of polymer-grade ethylene requires reducing C2H2 to below 5 ppm.24,25 The full conversion of trace acetylene in acetylene selective hydrogenation is limited by the low concentration of C2H2, so the use of more active precious metal Pd as the active sites is a common strategy in traditional acetylene selective hydrogenation.2628 For low- activity nonprecious metals, it seems to be a feasible solution to compensate for their lack of activity",

Introducing ILs into the three-phase interface can adjust the physicochemical properties of the three-phase interface by changing the anions and cations.33 Wang et al. found that ILs can enrich HCl around active sites to build an HCl-rich catalytically active microenvironment.13 Zhao et al. also found that the high solubility of the reactant gas in BmimNCN2 ILs can effectively reduce the apparent activation energy of the catalysts.34 Therefore, it is a feasible strategy to select ILs as the medium for catalytic reactions and to regulate the microenvironment of the three-phase interface. In this study, we report BmimClCu catalysts that regulate the microenvironment of the gassolidliquid three-phase interface based on the different solubilities of ILs to the reaction gas. The solubilities of C2H2 and C2H4 in ILs were measured by the pressure drop method.35 C2H2 has a stronger polarity, and its solubility in ILs is greater than that of C2H4.3638 Correlating the products of the EASR, we found that high C2H2 solubility is beneficial for improving the activity of the reaction. The mechanism by which ILs achieve full conversion of C2H2 is different from directly improving the activity of the active sites. ILs enrich trace C2H2 in an ethylene- rich stream through the high-solubility mechanism of C2H2, which represents the acetylene-rich microenvironment con- structed by ILs. This means that a higher probability of collision between the active site and C2H2 is conducive to the reaction. We further correlated the relationship between C2H4 selectivity and KC2H4KC2H2 and found that they showed a volcano-shaped curve, which provides a valuable descriptor for the selection of ILs. This work provides a new structure activity approach for understanding the relationship between the microenvironment regulation of the three-phase interface and the catalytic reaction performance. 2.

The three-elec- trode flow cell system is used for measuring catalyst performance Figure S1. The reaction is carried out in an environment of normal temperature and pressure. The CS3104 Wuhan CORRTEST Instrument Co., Ltd. electrochemical workstation is selected to provide the electrical energy required for the experiment. With HgHgO as the reference electrode, all potentials are converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode RHE reference scale using the relationship: ERHE EHgHgO 0.0594 pH 0.241, unless otherwise stated. The EASR exhibits excellent performance in an alkaline electrolyte environment, and 1 M KOH is adopted as the electrolyte. The flow rate of the electrolyte is adjusted according to the flow rate of the gas to ensure an optimal relationship during the reaction process. The gas flow rate during the experiment, unless otherwise specified, is 2 sccm for the 1 cm2 air chamber and 50 sccm for the 25 cm2 air chamber. After the experimental device and electrode are assembled and the leak detection step is completed, the reaction device is purged with the reaction gas for 0.5 h. The flow rate is consistent with the reaction flow rate. Both the pure C2H2 flow and the ethylene-rich stream are regulated by mass flow controllers Horiba-SN48.

It is equipped with a capillary column ShimCap-PLOT Al2O3 that can detect the C1C10 products. Another channel is a thermal conductivity detector TCD used to detect the H2 produced. 2.6. Calculations.

In the EASR, C2H2 molecules in the gas phase need to undergo dissolution and diffusion in the solution before reaching the catalysts surface. However, acetylene is a nonpolar molecule and has low solubility in polar water solutions.3538 The gas diffusion electrode is selected instead of the H-type electrode to partially eliminate the effect of gas dissolution and diffusion in the electrolyte on the reaction when it is the rate-determining step and to overcome the problem of the low solubility of acetylene.31,32 In this work, we continue to optimize the three-phase interface properties of",

Nickel foam and HgHgO are used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively.43,44 Figure 1a shows a schematic diagram of the three-phase interface microenviron- ment constructed by using ILs, while the catalytic reaction layer at the three-phase interface is composed of ILs and Cu NPs. Figure 1b shows the C2H2 conversion for the Cu NPs, BmimClCu, and P666NTF2Cu catalysts at a flow rate of 2 mL min1 and a constant current of 3 mA. The results for the BmimClCu and Cu NP catalysts show that ILs have the function of enriching trace acetylene and can achieve full conversion of acetylene. On the other hand, the BmimClCu catalysts prepared with hydrophilic ILs achieved complete conversion of acetylene, while the C2H2 conversion of the P666NTF2Cu catalysts prepared with hydrophobic ILs is only 49. This indicates that the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of ILs are crucial for regulating the properties of the three- phase interface. To further study the influence of hydro- philicity and hydrophobicity, the sample capacity of ILs was expanded to 12 Figure S3. Figure S4 shows a photo of 12 ILs mixed with 1 M KOH the yellow color developer is added only for easy observation. BmimPF6 and P666NTF2 ILs are hydrophobic in 1 M KOH, while the other ILs are hydrophilic. Figures S5S8 and Table S1 show the performance of these catalysts in the EASR, and hydrophilic ILs show better catalytic activity. This indicates that using hydrophilic ILs to regulate the microenvironment of the three-phase interface in the EASR has greater advantages and provides new guidance for the design of EASR catalysts. The solubilities of C2H2 and C2H4 in ILs are measured using the pressure drop method Figure S9. The Henry coefficients of the solubilities of C2H2 and C2H4 in ILs are shown in Figure S10 and Table S1.13 The average value of KC2H2 in ILs is 4 times smaller than that in 1 M KOH.

This indicates that the solubility of acetylene in ILs is significantly improved. The Henry coefficient of KC2H2 is lower than KC2H4, which suggests that the solubility of acetylene in ILs is higher than that of ethylene, while the Henry coefficient of ethylene in ILs is not much different from that in electrolytes. This suggests that regulating the properties of ILs mainly affects the solubility of acetylene in ILs. To further compare the effect of acetylene solubility on the EASR, we increased the acetylene flow rate to 10 mL min1, and the relationship between C2H2 conversion and KC2H2 is depicted in Figure 1c. The experimental results show that the solubility of C2H2 is positively correlated with the activity of the EASR, which indicates that the use of ILs to construct an acetylene-rich microenvironment is beneficial for the full conversion of trace acetylene. Solubility can be used as an important indicator for the selection of ILs. Figure 1d shows the relationship between KC2H4KC2H2 and ethylene selectivity. Obviously, a volcano-shaped curve obtained with BmimCl ILs showed the highest ethylene selectivity. 3.2. Constructs of the Three-Phase Interface Struc- ture.

Subsequently, GDEs with a uniform dispersion of Cu NPs and ILs are obtained by ultrasonication, dispersion, spraying, and drying. The dispersion and morphology of Cu NPs and BmimClCu catalysts are investigated. The SEM image shows that Cu NPs present an atypical round structure Figure 2a.

To further confirm the presence of IL film on the Cu NP surface, we characterized the HAADF-STEM micrographs of the BmimClCu catalysts Figure 2gi. The EDS mapping results for Cu and Cl elements show that BmimCl ILs are uniformly dispersed on the surface of Cu NPs. Additional HAADF-STEM images of other regions are provided in Figure S11. In Figure 2j, XRD results show that the main diffraction peak positions of the catalysts are the same, which is due to the fcc structure of Cu with characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ 43.3, 50.4, and 74.1. A small amount of Cu2O peaks appeared on the surface of the BmimClCu catalysts.45 This indicates that BmimCl ILs exhibit oxidative properties but do not change the crystal structure of Cu NPs. To investigate the electronic structures and coordination environments of Cu NPs and BmimClCu catalysts, X-ray absorption spectroscopy XAS measurements are performed. Figure 2k shows the normalized X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy XANES curves of the catalysts at the Cu K-edge, along with Cu foil and CuO as references. The oxidation state of Cu in the BmimClCu catalysts is higher than that of Cu NPs. This is due to the partial oxidation of the catalyst surface. The results in Figure 2l show that there are some CuO bonds in the BmimClCu catalysts. Wavelet transform WT data Figure 2m clearly show that CuCu bonds dominate in the BmimClCu catalysts, with a small number of CuO bonds. The above characterization indicates that BmimCl ILs mainly cover the surface of Cu NPs in the form of thin films. 3.3. Acetylene Electroreduction under a Pure Acetylene Flow. The EASR is performed on BmimClCu and Cu NP catalysts in a typical three-electrode flow cell with 1 M KOH as the electrolyte under a 15 sccm pure acetylene flow Figure 3a. In Figure 3b, the linear sweep voltammetry LSV curve of BmimClCu catalysts shows a significant positive shift compared with Ar, indicating that it has activity for the EASR. The electrochemical window of Cu NP catalysts is 115 mV, which is smaller than the 348 mV of BmimClCu catalysts Figure S12. This suggests that the addition of BmimCl ILs can effectively inhibit the HER activity. Figure 3c,d shows the FE of Cu NPs and BmimClCu catalysts at high current density, respectively. The FE of the BmimClCu catalysts is significantly higher than that of the Cu NP catalysts. The FE of the BmimClCu catalysts is as high as 97.8 at 300 mA cm2. BmimClCu catalysts produce more C4 byproducts, Figure 4. a Selectivity and conversion of EASR products at different current densities over BmimClCu catalysts at a flow rate of 2 sccm. b Residual acetylene content in product gas under different ethylene-rich streams. c Selectivity of EASR products at different flow rates and C2H2 conversion over BmimClCu catalysts in the homemade 1 cm2 and 25 cm2 device. d",

The loading ratio of ILs and Cu NPs is crucial for the regulation of the three-phase interface. Figure S13 shows the relationship between the ratio of metalILs loading and FE . The optimal mass ratio of ILCu is 0.5, and the FE reaches 97.8. Figure 3e shows the relationship between the mass ratio of ILCu and the EASR product production. The production of 5.5 mmol h1 cm2 ethylene products can be achieved at a current density of 300 mA cm2. As shown in Figure 3f, the strategy of using ILs to construct an acetylene-rich microenvironment is compared with the results of recently reported advanced cata- lysts.1620,4649 The comparative results show that the BmimClCu catalysts have a significant FE advantage at high current density, which indicates that the strategy of regulating the microenvironment of the three-phase interface with ILs is effective. 3.4. Acetylene Electroreduction under an Ethylene- Rich Stream. The EASR is mainly used for the removal of impurities from crude ethylene gas. Therefore, an ethylene-rich stream 0.5 C2H2, 20 C2H4, and Ar simulating industrial gas is used as the reaction gas in this study. Figure 4a shows acetylene conversion and ethylene selectivity for an ethylene- rich stream at different currents. Under a current density of 1 mA cm2, C2H2 cannot be completely converted, and the main byproduct is C4. When the current density increases to 3 mA cm2, the acetylene in the ethylene-rich stream can be completely converted with 90 ethylene selectivity. The acetylene content of polymerization-grade ethylene in industrial reactions is required to be as low as 5 ppm.50,51 Therefore, an ethylene-rich stream is used as the reaction gas to achieve full conversion of acetylene as much as possible. The content of acetylene at different flow rates is further investigated Figure 4b. When the gas flow rate is lower than 2.5 sccm, it can meet the demand for polymerization-grade acetylene production and achieve full conversion of acetylene in an ethylene-rich stream at a flow rate of 2 sccm. This indicates that the strategy of enriching acetylene in an ethylene-rich stream through the high acetylene solubility of ILs to provide an acetylene-rich microenvironment for the active sites of Cu NPs is feasible. To achieve higher C2H2 impurity removal efficiency with BmimClCu catalysts, we enlarged the area of the gas chamber for performance evaluation from 1 to 25 cm2 Figure S14. Figure 4c",

Figure 4c shows the results of the EASR in 1 and 25 cm2 gas chambers at different flow rates. The selectivity of ethylene increases with the increase of flow rate under the same gas chamber conditions. This indicates that the carboncarbon coupling reaction is proportional to the residence time of the reactants in the S-shaped flow channel. The enlarged reactor can increase the gas flow rate to 50 sccm, achieving complete conversion of C2H2 impurities into C2H4 to meet various production requirements. Figure 4d shows the results of the long-term evaluation of BmimClCu catalysts. Full conversion of acetylene is achieved over a long reaction time of 120 h, with ethylene selectivity greater than 90 and FE greater than 75 at steady state. This indicates that ILs have great potential for application in industrial EASRs. 3.5. Reaction Mechanism. Figure 5a shows the Tafel slopes of the BmimClCu and Cu NP catalysts.

EIS curves verify the performance of the BmimClCu and Cu NP catalysts Figure 5b. The electrochemical impedance of BmimClCu catalysts under pure acetylene flow is smaller than that of Cu NP catalysts. This suggests that BmimClCu catalysts have better catalytic effects in the EASR. To further study the advantages of BmimClCu catalysts, the DFT theoretical calculation method is used to study the structureactivity relationship between the catalyst surface structure and catalytic perform- ance. Figure 5c shows that acetylene is more strongly adsorbed on the Cu surface than ethylene. This indicates that ethylene easily desorbs from the surface of Cu catalysts without undergoing overhydrogenation. In contrast, the adsorption difference between acetylene and ethylene on the surface of the BmimClCu catalyst is larger, indicating that the presence of ILs makes ethylene desorption easier. Figure 5df shows the in situ attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared ATR-FTIR spectroscopy of Cu NPs and BmimClCu catalysts. The adsorption peak at 1625 cm1 represents the adsorption of acetylene Figure 5d. In contrast, the adsorption peak of acetylene in the BmimClCu catalyst red- shifts to 1638 cm1 and the peak intensity of acetylene is larger.20 This indicates that C2H2 in the ILs forms weaker adsorption on the catalyst surface.

Due to the enrichment of acetylene by ILs, the amount of acetylene adsorbed on the catalyst surface increases. To better investigate the origin of EASR activity and ethylene selectivity at the molecular level, DFT calculations are performed on the hydrogenation process. We studied the projected density of states of C2H2 adsorption on the surfaces of the BmimClCu and Cu NP catalysts. Figure 6a shows that the d-band centers of BmimClCu and Cu NP catalysts are 2.32 eV and 2.45 eV, respectively. According to the d-band center theory, the adsorption strength of C2H2 on BmimClCu is weaker than that on Cu NPs. This indicates that ILs are beneficial for the adsorption configuration of acetylene to change from di-σ adsorption to weak π adsorption.32 This is consistent with the results of the in situ ATR-FTIR. Figures 6b and S15 show the differential charge density for acetylene adsorption on the catalysts. The results showed that Cu acted as an electron donor and acetylene acted as an electron acceptor. In contrast, the BmimClCu catalysts can provide more electrons to facilitate the activation of acetylene.52 In order to further study the reaction mechanism of the EASR on the BmimClCu catalysts, the proposed reaction pathway is shown in Figures 6c and S16. The rate-determining step during C2H4 formation on the BmimClCu catalysts is C2H2 to C2H3, with a ΔG barrier of 0.5 eV, which is much lower than that on Cu NPs 0.83 eV. The desorption of C2H4 from the BmimClCu and Cu NP catalysts requires less energy than the formation of the C2H5 intermediate, indicating that the catalysts are not prone to overhydrogenation reactions. This is consistent with the fact that the formation of C2H6 byproducts is almost undetectable during the experiment. The above results indicate that the BmimClCu catalysts, with the solid liquid three-phase interface constructed by ILs, have a reasonable reaction pathway in the EASR. 4. CONCLUSION The catalytic microenvironment at the three-phase interface is crucial for electrochemical reactions. This work leverages the solubility differences of ILs for C2H2 and C2H4 to construct an acetylene-rich microenvironment, solving the problem of insufficient activity of nonprecious metals for trace acetylene. We found that hydrophilic ILs can effectively inhibit HERs, and increasing the solubility of acetylene at the three-phase interface can effectively improve the efficiency of the EASR.

Structural reconstruction from Cu dissolution and reduction under negative potentials undermines their long-term stability. Herein, a novel Cu2OCeOx core-shell nanocatalyst is introduced, featuring a Cu2O nanocube core encapsulated by an amorphous CeOx shell. Due to the facilitated electron transfer of abundant CuCe interfaces, the CeOx shell layer simultaneously prevents the agglomeration and maintains the oxidation state of Cu2O nanocubes, bringing in signiﬁcantly improved stability. Unlike conventional coating layers, the defective CeOx shell uniquely avoids obstructing mass transfer while eﬀectively promoting the activation of CO2 and optimizing the electronic structure of Cu. The Cu2OCeOx nanocatalyst delivers a remarkable C2 Faradaic eﬃciency exceeding 80 at 300 mA cm2 under a low applied potential of 0.98 V, with exceptional durability lasting over 50 h, compared to just 2 h for Cu2O alone. This work presents an eﬀective strategy to enhance catalyst stability without sacriﬁcing activity, advancing the design of durable catalysts for electrocatalytic applications. 1. Introduction Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction CO2RR of- fers a sustainable approach to closing the carbon cycle by con- verting CO2 into value-added products such as CO, HCOOH, CH4, C2H5OH, C2H4, etc. Among these products, multi-carbon C2 products, including C2H4, a vital chemical feedstock, and C2H5OH, a high-energy-density fuel, are particularly desirable.1 Y.

Furthermore, the Cu site is widely recognized for possessing lower energy for C-C coupling, in com- parison to zero-valent or higher-valent Cu. Therefore, many researchers have focused on the optimization of Cu sites in Cu-based catalysts for improving the faradaic eﬃciency of C2 products.2 Cu2O nanoparticles with abundant Cu sites have been widely used for C2 production.3 Compared to polycrystalline Cu2O, the Cu2O nanocube exhibited superior C2 selectivity because of the enhanced C-C coupling reaction on their 100 facets.3c However, the stability of the Cu2O nanocube is compromised by Cu reduction at the negative potentials of CO2RR and the dissolution of Cu ions, leading to aggregation and degradation of the reactive 100 facets.3a,b The instability of Cu2O nanocubes, especially in ﬂow-type devices, is a signiﬁcant challenge.

The C2C1 product ratio drops dramatically from 3.5 to 1 accom- panied by the current density declining from 300 to 150 mA cm2 within 100 mins. Current modiﬁcation strategies, such as creat- ing heterointerfaces, help preserve the Cu valence state in poly- crystalline Cu2O.4 However, these methods are unable to main- tain the crucial 100 facets of Cu2O nanocubes. Moreover, both the Faradaic eﬃciency for C2 products and the stability close to 60 for 25 h must be signiﬁcantly improved for industrial applications. This underscores the urgent need for strategies to stabilize Cu2O nanocubes for higher C2 production. Cerium dioxide CeO2 is widely recognized as an eﬀective modiﬁer in heterogeneous catalysis because of the reversible Ce4Ce3 redox transition.5 The easy switch between Ce4 and Ce3 in CeO2 has the potential to maintain the oxidation state of Cu. Additionally, the frustrated-Lewis pairs could be constructed in the defect-rich surface of CeOx,6 which promoted the adsorp- tion and activation of CO2 for CO2 conversion.7 Thus, using CeOx as the protection layer is promising to stabilize the inner Cu2O nanocube without hindering CO2 mass transfer or com- promising activity. However, creating a thin, defective CeOx shell on the surface of the Cu2O nanocube to optimize CO2RR perfor- mance is challenging. Adv. Funct.

The design and advantages of Cu2OCeOx coreshell nanocatalyst supported on carbon paper for CO2RR. In this work, we successfully synthesized a core-shell structure of Cu2O nanocube core covered with an amorphous CeOx shell via a simple hydrothermal method by optimizing the adding ratio of Ce salt. As shown in Figure 1, the ultrathin CeOx shell layer can inhibit the leaching of inside Cu ions and activate CO2 for further reduction on the Cu2O core. Meanwhile, the easy shift between Ce4 and Ce3 in CeOx can facilitate the electron transfer and reg- ulate the electronic structure of Cu for maintaining the oxidation state of Cu2O in Cu2OCeOx. Thus, the stability of Cu2OCeOx has been greatly improved while maintaining its high eﬃciency. The Cu2OCeOx catalyst delivers a high C2 Faradaic eﬃciency FE of above 80 at 300 mA cm2 under a low applied poten- tial of 0.98 V, and the durability enhances from 2 h of Cu2O to more than 50 h under the large current density of 300 mA cm2 for Cu2OCeOx. 2.

The high-resolution transmission electron microscope HR-TEM image of the nanocube is shown in Figure 2b. The lattice fringe of 0.21 nm corresponding to the 111 plane of Cu2O was observed in the inner part, while no lat- tice fringes were detected in the thin surface layer 1.5 nm. The high-angle annular dark-ﬁeld-scanning transmission elec- tron microscopy HAADF-STEM image Figure 2c; Figure S2a, Supporting Information further conﬁrms that the nanocube is covered with a thin semitransparent layer. The corresponding en- ergy dispersive spectroscopy EDS mapping images Figure 2c; Figure S2b, Supporting Information show that only the signal of Ce and O were detected in the surface semitransparent layer, and the signal of Cu was distributed uniformly in the inner part. These results indicate that the CuCe3 sample is a uniform nanocube structure with a crystal Cu2O core covered with an amorphous CeOx shell. So, the CuCe3 sample was named as Cu2OCeOx. When increasing the adding content of Ce, the ag- gregated CeO2 nanoparticles appeared beside the nanocube mor- phology in CuCe5 and CuCe8 Figures S3, S4, Supporting In- formation. The reference sample of Cu2O Figure S5, Support- ing Information was synthesized using the same method with Cu2OCeOx without adding cerium salt. The X-ray diﬀraction XRD patterns and the Raman spec- troscopy of Cu2O and Cu2OCeOx are shown in Figure 2d,e. Only the peaks ascribed to Cu2O were observed in both Cu2O and Cu2OCeOx, further conﬁrming the amorphous struc- ture of CeOx in Cu2OCeOx. Also, nearly no angle shifts for Cu2O diﬀraction peaks in Cu2OCeOx were detected compared with those of Cu2O, consistent with the core-shell structure of Cu2OCeOx instead of Ce doping Cu2O.4b,5b This ﬁnding is fur- ther corroborated by the extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure EXAFS spectra shown in Figure 2f. Similar to pure Cu2O, only the CuO bond 1.5 Å and CuOCu bond 3.1 Å have ex- isted in Cu2OCeOx.8 XPS and X-ray absorption near edge structure XANES were employed to analyze the electronic structure of Cu2OCeOx. The Cu 2p XPS spectrum Figure 3a shows that the peak of Cu 2p32 at 932.7 eV is attributed to Cu0 or Cu.9 The Cu LMM Auger spectrum Figure S6, Supporting Information fur- ther demonstrates the existence of Cu.10 Signiﬁcantly, the Cu2OCeOx exhibits an obvious shift in the Cu0 or Cu peak of the Cu 2p32 to the negative direction by 0.3 eV when com- pared with Cu2O, suggesting the strong electronic interactions between Cu2O and CeOx.5b,c The XPS spectra of CuCe5 and CuCe8 Figure S7, Supporting Information reveal a consis- tent negative shift of 0.3 eV in the Cu 2p32 peak compared to pristine Cu2O.

The pre- edge line of Cu2OCeOx is between Cu foil and Cu2O, indicat- ing that the average valence state of Cu was between the metallic state and the cuprous state.11 The Ce L3-edge XANES spectrum Figure 3c shows that the Ce pre-edge line of Cu2OCeOx po- sitions between CeCl3 and CeO2. The linear combination ﬁtting LCF further shows that the ratio of Ce3 is 48 Figure S8 and Table S1, Supporting Information.12 This is in excellent agree- ment with the 49 Ce3 ratio determined from the Ce 3d XPS spectrum Figure 3d, conﬁrming the consistency and accuracy of our analysis. The much higher ratio of Ce3 is from the amor- phous structure of CeOx and the electronic interactions between Cu2O and CeOx in Cu2OCeOx.5b,c,13 We then calculated the charge density diﬀerence of the optimized Ce4O7Cu2O model Figures S9, S10, Supporting Information to investigate the in- terfacial electronic eﬀect between Cu2O and CeOx. As shown in Figure 3e, the charge is transferred from Ce4O7 to Cu2O. Bader charge analysis further suggests that the overall Ce4O7 transfers 0.87 eto Cu2O. The O 1s XPS spectra of Cu2OCeOx and Cu2O are shown in Figure 3f. Compared with Cu2O, a large number of oxygen vacancy defects are observed for Cu2OCeOx, which result from its high ratio of Ce3. The abundant Ce3 and oxy- gen vacancies of the CeOx shell are beneﬁcial for the activation of CO2,7,14 and the Cu sites from the Cu2O core of Cu2OCeOx can promote C-C coupling to C2 products.2 2.2. CO2RR Performances and Reaction Mechanism The electrochemical performances of Cu2O and Cu2OCeOx to- ward the CO2RR were evaluated in a ﬂow cell with 1.0 m KOH solution as the electrolyte, and the carbon paper was used as the gas diﬀusion electrode GDE. The polarization curves without iR compensation of Cu2O and Cu2OCeOx were obtained in an Ar or CO2 atmosphere Figure 4a.

Furthermore, in a CO2 atmosphere, Cu2OCeOx achieves even higher current densities and a more positively shifted onset potential compared to Ar, demonstrating its eﬃciency for CO2 reduction. To clarify the higher CO2RR activity of Cu2OCeOx, we conducted elec- trochemical impedance spectroscopy EIS measurements to as- sess the charge-transfer capacity of the catalysts.15 As shown in Figure 4b, Cu2OCeOx has a smaller charge transfer resistance than Cu2O. This indicates that the CeOx with abundant Ce3 and oxygen vacancies facilitates the electron transfer in Cu2OCeOx. Adv. Funct.

Then we discuss the eﬀect of the CeOx shell on the selec- tivity of CO2RR products. We utilized a 30-min constant cur- rent method for testing purposes. Gas chromatography eﬀec- tively detected the resulting gas phase products Figure S11, Sup- porting Information, and nuclear magnetic resonance NMR spectroscopy was employed to detect the liquid phase products Figure S12, Supporting Information. As shown in Figure 4c and Figure S13 Supporting Information, the CO2RR products for Cu2O and Cu2OCeOx are nearly the same. The CO2RR prod- ucts are dependent on current density due to the increasing ap- plied potentials.11 The FE of the C2 products of Cu2OCeOx Figure 4d is higher than that of Cu2O starting from the large current density of 200 mA cm2. Cu2OCeOx exhibits the high- est FE of 81.8 at a current of 300 mA cm2. Moreover, the ap- plied potentials of Cu2OCeOx Figure 4d are much lower to reach the same current densities than those of Cu2O. This in- dicates that the ultrathin CeOx shell does not hinder the mass transfer of CO2RR, but rather has the potential to enhance the adsorption and activation of CO2 discussed below. For CuCe5 and CuCe8, the presence of a thicker CeOx shell leads to the declined FE of C2 products as shown in Figure S14 Support- ing Information. Notably, the CuCe8 sample exhibits a marked reduction in FE for C2 products to 50.6 at 300 mA cm2, ac- companied by an increase in the FE of CH4. This selectivity",

Notably, the CuCe8 sample exhibits a marked reduction in FE for C2 products to 50.6 at 300 mA cm2, ac- companied by an increase in the FE of CH4. This selectivity shift may originate from the enhanced hydrogenation capacity of the thicker CeO2 nanoparticle shell, which disrupts the C-C coupling pathway while promoting the sequential hydrogenation of CO intermediates toward the formation of methane.14 The long- term stability performance of Cu2OCeOx is shown in Figure 4f. The potential remains steady and the FE of C2 products main- tains above 80 under the large current density of 300 mA cm2 for 50 h, demonstrating the excellent stability of Cu2OCeOx. The high C2 FE and long durability time under the large current density of 300 mA cm2 make Cu2OCeOx comparable with those of the state-of-the-art CO2RR electrocatalysts Figure 4e. To further elucidate the key intermediates and gain a deeper understanding of the CO2RR mechanism, we collected in situ surface enhanced Raman scattering SERS, Figure S15, Sup- porting Information spectra and in situ attenuated total re- ﬂectance surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy ATR-SEIRAS. As shown in Figure 5a, the peak at 373 cm1 is attributed to the CuCO stretching,16 which represents a strong interaction between Cu and CO.17 This indicates that CO2RR occurs on the surface of the Cu2O inner core, and the CeOx shell does not inhibit the mass transfer for the reaction. As the po- tential becomes more negative, the peak at 529 cm1 ascribed to CH2CHO becomes obvious while the peak at 1064 cm1 as- cribed to carbonate decreases remarkably.18 This indicates the CO2RR progresses vigorously for the generation of C2 products over Cu2OCeOx. In situ ATR-SEIRAS spectroscopy Figure 5b further detects peaks around 1245, 1190 and 1589 cm1 corre- sponding to CHO, the CO stretching band of COCHO and symmetric COCHO, respectively.19 The OCCHO is the key in- termediate revealing the pathway of C-C coupling between CO Adv.

The DFT calculations in Figure 5d show that the adsorption energy for CO2 adsorption is markedly lower over CeOx than over Cu2O Figures S17S19, Support- ing Information.

Discussion on the High Stability of Cu2OCeOx In this section, we will discuss the exceptional stability of Cu2OCeOx.

    "text": "this section, we will discuss the exceptional stability of Cu2OCeOx. The 4.5-h constant CO2RR tests at 300 mA cm2 was performed for Cu2O Figure 6a and Cu2OCeOx Figure 6b. For Cu2O, The FE of C2H4 decreases drastically start- ing from 2 h along with the increase of the FE of H2. In the end, the FE of C2H4 decreases to below 10 and the FE of H2 reaches above 70. In contrast, the FEs of C2H4 and H2 only ﬂuctuate slightly within the 4.5 h for Cu2OCeOx Figure 6b. These re- sults demonstrate the positive eﬀect of the CeOx shell on the sta- bility of Cu2O for CO2RR. To further investigate the mechanism of stability enhancement in Cu2OCeOx, the morphologies of Cu2O and Cu2OCeOx after stability tests were obtained ﬁrst. The uniform distributed nanoparticles in fresh Cu2O Figure S24, Supporting Informa- tion aggregate and form the porous honeycomb structure for Cu2O-4.5h Figure 6c, indicating a signiﬁcant structural recon- struction has occurred for Cu2O during the constant CO2RR. For Cu2OCeOx-4.5h Figure 6d, the morphology of the uniformly distributed nanoparticles is still present. This signiﬁcant diﬀer- ence demonstrates that the CeOx shell layer can prevent Cu2O from dissolution Figure S25, Supporting Information and re- construction. To obtain the chemical state of Cu after the stability tests, we collected both XRD Figure 6e and Cu LMM Figure 6f patterns. The XRD pattern shows that the peaks of Cu at 43 and 50 corresponding to the 111 and 200 planes of metal Cu appear in Cu2O-4.5h. Moreover, the intensity of the Cu111 peak at 43 is basically the same as the peak of Cu2O111 at 36, indicating that a large number of Cu ions are reduced to metal Cu for Cu2O-4.5h. While for Cu2OCeOx-4.5h, the in- tensity of the Cu111 peak is very low and the peak of Cu200 can hardly be seen, illustrating most of Cu in Cu2OCeOx re- mains oxidation state. Also, the Cu LMM Auger spectra exhibit that the peak of Cu in Cu2O Figure 6e is signiﬁcantly shifted toward Cu0 918.6 eV in Cu2O-4.5h, while Cu2OCeOx-4.5h re- mains in Cu 916.7 eV. To verify the protective eﬀect of the CeOx shell on the valence state more intuitively, we compared the CV curves under the Ar atmosphere Figure S26, Supporting Information, and the copper redox of Cu2OCeOx is obviously inhibited. To make a short summary, the CeOx shell, on one hand, can prohibit the Cu2O nanoparticle core from aggregation and structural reconstruction by stable Cu ions from leaching and Adv. Funct.

On another hand, the CeOx shell can maintain the oxidation state of Cu due to the facilitated electron transfer and the easy shift between Ce4 and Ce3.5a,23 3. Conclusion In summary, we developed a highly eﬃcient and stable core-shell structure electrocatalyst composed of Cu2O nanocube core and CeOx shell for CO2RR. In situ, spectroscopy and DFT calcula- tions demonstrate that the CeOx shell promotes the activation of CO2 and optimizes the electronic structure of the Cu2O core for the decreasing energy barrier of CHO, which is the key in- termediate for C-C coupling. The Cu2OCeOx catalyst shows an enhanced C2 FE of 81.8 and a decreased applied potential of 0.98 V at 300 mA cm2 compared with 72 and 1.2 V of Cu2O. More importantly, Cu2OCeOx delivers long-term stabil- ity of 50 h under the larger current density of 300 mA cm2, while the Cu2O catalyst only lasts 2 h. The greatly improved stability of Cu2OCeOx resulted from the CeOx shell that maintains the morphology and valence state of the Cu2O core. This work paves the way for improving the activity and stability of unstable metal electrocatalysts at the same time toward various energy applica- tions.

Sargent 5,6 David Sinton 1 Electrocatalysis offers a promising route to convert CO2 into alcohols, which is most efﬁcient in a two-step cascade reaction with CO2-to-CO followed by CO- to-alcohol. However, current alcohol-producing CO2CO electrolyzers suffer from low selectivity or alcohol crossover, resulting in alcohol concentrations of less than 1, which are further diluted in downstream cold-traps. As a result, electrocatalytic alcohol production has yet to be scaled beyond the lab 1-10 cm2. Here, we reverse the electroosmotic drag of water using a cation exchange membrane assembly, enabling the recovery of over 85 of alcohol products at a concentration of 6 wt.. We develop a multi-step condenser strategy to separate the produced alcohols from the efﬂuent gas stream without dilution. Scaling up this approach to an 800 cm2 cell resulted in an output of 200 mL alcoholday. The electrosynthesis of ethanol through carbon dioxide reduc- tion reactions CO2R provides a potential carbon-neutral path- way for converting intermittent renewable energy into liquid products that are storable and shippable15. Ethanol C2H5OH and n-propanol C3H7OH have been identiﬁed as particularly appealing electrolysis products in this regard, in view of their market size and carbon intensity6. The conventional approach to ethanol production is carbon-intensive, as life-cycle assessments indicate a carbon intensity of bioethanol exceeding that of con- ventional gasoline, thus motivating the development of low- carbon alcohol production pathways7. While bio-electrochemical and thermochemical methods are capable of upgrading CO2 to ethanol and other multicarbon products, they suffer from lower efﬁciencies or higher carbon footprints compared to electro- chemical production813. Recent advances in gas diffusion electrodes GDEs, electrolyzer design, and catalysts have enabled the production of alcohols with a high faradaic efﬁciency FE1417 while operating at industrially relevant current densities 100 mAcm26,18. However, these systems are not suited for scale-up due to a combination of crossover of produced alcohol to the anode electrolyte, low single-pass conversion efﬁciency SPCE, and low energy efﬁciency EE19. In traditional membrane electrode assemblies MEAs equipped with an anion exchange membrane AEM, up to 80 of alcohols cross the AEM to the anolyte20 via diffusion21 and electroosmotic drag2224. This crossover risks the oxidation of produced alcohols to acetate or CO2, and the alcohols that remain are diluted to 0.05 wt. in the anolyte25. Alcohols in such low concentrations cannot be economically recovered, because the energy cost for puriﬁcation would exceed the energy content of the alcohols by more than an order of magnitude25,26. Strategies to collect concentrated alcohols with low crossover rates typically require multi-membrane or solid-state elec- trolyte systems prone to high cell voltages 3 V20,25,27,28 and limita- tions in SPCE CO2 utilizations 252934. The complexity of suchmulti- membrane systems poses an additional barrier to scaling, which is a challenge",

This approach also avoids the issue of reactant CO2 loss to carbonate formation, which is typical of one-step CO2R electrolyzers. Since CO does not form carbonates, COR systems can operate with alkaline electrolytes at both the anode and cathode, minimizing the cathode overpotential and Nernstian pH gradient potential. Previous studies combining SOECs with COR demonstrated CO-to-C2H4 electrolyzers with 20 EEs and superior SPCEs compared to CO2R systems37. Despite progress in reducing CO to multicarbon products such as ethylene38,39 and acetate4042, high-concentration, low-crossover CO-to-alcohols electrolyzers have yet to be produced at a relevant scale4345. Electrodes for CO-to-alcohol systems are currently limited in size to 5 cm2 14,17,46,47, while CO-to-acetate systems have achieved scales upward of 100 cm2 for individual cells42. In addition, the method to collect and measure alcohols from the gas outlet in both COR and CO2R systems dilute the ﬁnal alcohol product in water-ﬁlled cold-traps. This method enables the measurement of the pre-diluted alcohol concentration but prevents scaled production, which requires the product in concentrated form. Here, we report large-scale electrocatalytic alcohol production from CO at high recovery rates. We prevented the dilution of alco- hols observed in conventional AEM electrolyzers by reversing the ion ﬂow and the associated electroosmotic water ﬂux. Using a cation exchange membrane CEM electrolyzer, we collected 85 of alcohols produced by COR from the cathode gas outlet. Scaling this approach from 5 to 50 cm2 highlighted the limitation of the con- ventional cold-trap method for capturing the alcohol products. To address this, we developed a scalable multi-step condensation strategy that recovers 95 of alcohols from the efﬂuent gas stream at viable concentrations, without dilution. We further demonstrated the scalability by operating an 800 cm2 cell, which is the largest single COR electrolyzer",

Our approach enabled stable alcohol electrosynthesis for over 100 hours. With a stable, large area cell, this work provides a model for scaled alcohol electroproduction. Results Alcohol production and crossover investigation We sought ﬁrst to understand how membranes affect alcohol pro- duction and crossover in COR MEA electrolyzers. We began by assembling an AEM PiperION-40 μm MEA and a CEM Naﬁon 1110 MEA with cathodes consisting of a high PTFE content gas diffusion layer GDL and a catalyst of sprayed CuO nanoparticles CuONP Fig. 1A and B. A high PTFE content was used to prevent ﬂooding of the electrolyzer due to excess water from the CEM48. These tests employed a commercial CuO NP catalyst in a standard MEA electrolyzer. We selected the PiperION AEM for its low water uptake, which reduces electroosmotic drag from the cathode to anode to minimize the alcohols transported to the anolyte. For the CEM MEA electrolyzer, we selected a thick Naﬁon membrane with low water transport 1110 CEM to minimize the electroosmotic drag of water from the anode-to- cathode that can dilute the alcohols.

While both cells demonstrated a similar product distribution, the CEM electrolyzer produced a higher total alcohol FE of 35, compared to 24 alcohol FE with the AEM electrolyzer, at a current density of 200 mAcm2 Supplementary Fig. 1A. We chose a current density of 200 mAcm2 because higher current densities are preferable for industrial application2. The difference in alcohol FE of the CEM elec- trolyzer is due to the elevated hydroxide and cation concentration at the cathode, which enhances CORR rate and reduces the hydrogen evolution reaction HER. The negatively charged CEM retains OH- ions at the cathode and facilitates the transport of cations from the anolyte, increasing the cation concentration and stabilizing active inter- mediates in the CORR process4951. Furthermore, the CEM electrolyzer suffered less alcohol crossover, retaining 85 of the generated alcohols on the cathode side, compared to only 16 with the AEM electrolyzer Supplementary Fig. 1B. We attributed this difference in alcohol crossover between the AEM and CEM to reversing the direction of electroosmotic drag, which served to block advective and diffusive transport of ethanol from the cathode to the anode Fig. 1A and B. The CEM MEA had a higher full-cell potential of -2.58 V compared to -2.47 with the AEM MEA due to greater ohmic resistance from the thicker membrane 254 µm vs. 40 µm. Electrochemical impedance spectro- scopy EIS showed series resistance Rs values of 0.45 Ω for the AEM MEA and 1.13 Ω for the CEM MEA Supplementary Fig. 2. Despite the higher voltage, the CEM outperforms the AEM in terms of alcohol retention on the cathode-side, with an EEalcohol-cathode of 10, com- pared to 2 for the AEM. We further explored the effect of electroosmotic drag in control experiments where we added 4 wt. ethanol to the catholyte and operated the cathode under hydrogen evolution reaction at 200 mA cm2 Supplementary Fig. 3. We measured the drop in ethanol con- centration after 5 hours of operation, with or without current, to quantify ethanol crossover caused by electroosmotic drag. We did not measure ethanol concentration in the anolyte as oxidation to acetate or CO2 occurs25. Applying current decreased cathode-side ethanol concentration in the AEM system, while it increased in the CEM system compared to no current. These results indicate thatthe direction of ion ﬂow modulates ethanol crossover. The CEM also reduced alcohol crossover without current, likely due to its greater thickness52,53. We then investigated the effect of the CEM thickness on alcohol crossover and electrolyzer performance Supplementary Fig. 4. Reducing the membrane thickness from 254 µm to 127 µm decreased the full-cell voltage by up to 0.08 V, reaching a value of 2.5 V, com- parable to the AEM MEA. However, the thinner",

Reducing the membrane thickness from 254 µm to 127 µm decreased the full-cell voltage by up to 0.08 V, reaching a value of 2.5 V, com- parable to the AEM MEA. However, the thinner Naﬁon 115 membrane retained nearly 10 less alcohol at the cathode side compared to the thicker Naﬁon 1110, consistent with previous studies showing higher alcohol crossover in thinner CEMs53. This highlights a trade-off between cell voltage and alcohol crossover with membrane thickness. Increasing the applied current density in both the AEM and CEM MEAs revealed a shift in alcohol selectivity from propanol to ethanol Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6. Furthermore, alcohol crossover increased with current density in the AEM MEA, while the effect was less pronounced in the CEM MEA. The increase in alcohol crossover in the AEM MEA highlights the effect of electroosmotic drag, where the water ﬂux from the anode to the cathode increases with the applied current, transferring more alcohol to the anolyte. The effect is less pronounced in the CEM MEA likely due to the already low degree of alcohol crossover at the measured currents. We performed a technoeconomic analysis that revealed alcohol dilution due to crossover in the AEM system, both in COR and CO2R conﬁgurations, increased the downstream separation costs by seven- fold Fig. 1C, Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8. Testing the CEM MEA with a CO2 feed revealed an HER of 90 due to immediate salt precipitation at the cathode54, suggesting that the single-membrane CEM conﬁguration is uniquely suited to CO feeds Supplementary Fig. 9.Compared to other CO2 electrolyzers targeting alcohol production, the CEM CO electrolyzer used in this work achieves greater alcohol recovery at the cathode side and does so in a simple single-membrane conﬁguration that is easier to scale Fig. 1D, Supplementary Note 2. Moreover, comparing the CEM MEA to pre- vious alcohol-producing systems revealed a lower total production energy cost due to the lower voltage and alcohol crossover achieved in the single membrane system Supplementary Tables 10 and 11. We concluded that this single-membrane CEM CO electrolyzer model is currently the most suitable for scaling. Optimization of the 1 cm2 Cell To minimize the energy cost of product separation, it is crucial to maximize the amount of alcohols recovered from the cathode gas outlet at the highest possible concentration Fig. 1C. Previous CO2R AEM systems employed elevated temperatures to enhance alcohol evaporation into the cathodic gas stream25. The increased vapor pressure of alcohols at higher temperatures increased alcohol con- centration and reduced alcohol crossover to the anode side. Here, in the COR CEM MEA electrolyzer, we found that increasing the tem- perature from 20 C to 50 C did not have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the alcohol FE or crossover Fig. 2A. However, the increase in cell tem- perature resulted in less-concentrated alcohol on the cathode side Fig. 2B. Higher cell temperatures increase the membranes water uptake55,",

However, the increase in cell tem- perature resulted in less-concentrated alcohol on the cathode side Fig. 2B. Higher cell temperatures increase the membranes water uptake55, which can induce more water electroosmotic drag from the anode to the cathode. The increased water uptake leads to greater evaporation of water from the cathode at higher temperatures, dilut- ing the alcohol condensed from the outlet gas. However, the increased water uptake did not lead to higher alcohol crossover, as it is counter to the direction of alcohol transport in the CEM architecture. Controlling the gas ﬂow rate is another means of inﬂuencing the outlet alcohol concentration23. We found that increasing the gas ﬂow rate from 10 sccm to 50 sccm doubled the cathodic alcohol con- centration to 6 wt., while improving FE and decreasing crossover Fig. 2C and D. We attributed the increase in cathodic ethanol con- centration to higher alcohol vaporization rates caused by increased convective mass transfer at higher carrier gas CO ﬂowrates Fig. 2E. While increasing gas ﬂowrate lowers carbon conversion efﬁciency CE, bypassing this issue is possible by condensing the alcohol pro- ducts and recirculating the outlet gas for multiple passes, which is an advantage unique to the phase-separable mixtures of reactant and product. Scaling to 50 cm2 at high recovery rates We scaled the CEM CO electrolyzer initially to 50 cm2. To simulate industrial-scale separation for alcohol production, we examined the feasibility of employing a condenser to collect the produced alcohols on the cathode side to avoid the limitations posed by conventional cold-trap liquid collectors. Although dilution cold-traps are convenient in laboratory-scale settings, they dilute the generated alcohols by adding excess water during the bubbling step. This lowers the alcohol concentration by an order of magnitude after product collection and may introduce more error in the measurement Supplementary Note 3. We ran an initial experiment at 200 mAcm2 using a single low- temperature condenser at 10 C. We observed a large drop in alcohol FE compared to a 5 cm2 bench-scale test with the liquid-collector Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. 10. We posited that the missing FE was due to the single condenser failing to trap all the alcohol products. We tested this hypothesis by simulating the condensation of the generated alcohols in Aspen Plus Supplementary Note 4 and Sup- plementary Fig. 11. We found that approximately 30 of cathodic ethanol cannot be trapped in the single 10 C condenser due to the high ﬂow rate of the carrier CO gas and the vapor pressure of ethanol. Article https:doi.org10.1038s41467-025-59180-9 Nature Communications 2025 16:4969 3 Since a high ﬂow rate is needed to minimize alcohol crossover, a method to condense alcohol while still maintaining a high ﬂow rate CO stream was required.

    "text": "3 Since a high ﬂow rate is needed to minimize alcohol crossover, a method to condense alcohol while still maintaining a high ﬂow rate CO stream was required. We hypothesized that the residual alcohols could be recovered by introducing a second downstream condenser at a lower temperature Fig. 3B. We conducted simulations with the second condenser at various inlet ﬂowrates to determine the fraction of total ethanol in the outlet stream that would be condensed, depending on the tempera- ture of the second condenser Fig. 3C. We found that a second con- denser with a temperature -30 C is needed to condense 95 of the ethanol in the outlet gas stream at these conditions. We replicated the 50 cm2 experiment using the two-stage con- denser strategy. The ﬁrst condenser remained at 10 C, while we kept the second at 78 C by immersing it in a bath with a dry iceiso- propanol mixture, ensuring the condensation of all alcohols. The ﬁrst condenser removed most of the water and prevented freezing in the second condenser. The FE for all products reached 98, with a total alcohol FE of approximately 28, mirroring the results of the bench- scale test Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. 10. The second condenser produced a stream of 28 wt. ethanol and 20 wt. propanol, summing up to 48 wt. for all alcohols Fig. 3E. Thus, the two-stage condenser strategy both eliminates the water dilution step, allowing alcohols to be captured at a higher concentration, and improves the overall alcohol recovery. A subsequent energy analysis indicates that the energy cost of operating a second condenser is small 3 of total energy input, Supplementary Note 5. This approach can be readily scaled to collect concentrated alcohols produced by much larger electrolyzers. Demonstration at 800 cm2 Building upon the outcomes from the 50 cm2 testing, we scaled up the electrolyzer size to 800 cm2, which is suitable for stacking in industrial applications and compatible with currently available commercial membranes Fig. 4A, Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13. Further details on the design of the 800 cm2 cell can be found in an earlier study56. Due to the large amount of water expected to be transported to the cathode via electroosmotic drag, we added a third pre-condenser stage at room temperature 20 C to remove the excess water. The electrolyzer operated at a lower current density of 100 mAcm2 compared to the previous test due to limitations of the mass ﬂow controller, increasing propanol FE to 18.5. We achieved an ethanol FE of 19, similar to the 5 cm2 and 50 cm2 electrolyzer Fig. 4B. The 800 cm2 electrolyzer experienced greater alcohol crossover to the anolyte, with approxi- mately 65 of alcohols retained at the cathode outlet, compared to 88 for the 5 cm2 and 50 cm2 cells. We attributed the increased alcohol crossover in the 800 cm2 electrolyzer to the higher feed-gas pressure, as the ﬂow ﬁeld design in the larger electrolyzer was not optimized to maintain the same pressure drop",

We attributed the increased alcohol crossover in the 800 cm2 electrolyzer to the higher feed-gas pressure, as the ﬂow ﬁeld design in the larger electrolyzer was not optimized to maintain the same pressure drop as in the smaller elec- trolyzers, with an overall pressure drop of 10 psi. This higher feed-gas pressure resulted in greater alcohol transport across the membrane and less ethanol evaporation, leading to greater alcohol crossover Supplementary Fig. 14. Improvements in pressure distribution on both sides of the MEA were needed to reduce pressure gradients. After adding the room-temperature condenser, both the 10 C and 78 C condensers collected higher alcohol concentrations 40 wt., as most of the water was removed in the ﬁrst stage Fig. 4C. The 800 cm2 electrolyzer demonstrated a production rate of 96 mLday of ethanol and 84 mLday of propanol Fig. 4D. To our knowledge, this system represents the largest-single cell COR demonstration, for any product, to date42. The 800 cm2 cell operated for two hours with no measurable change in performance and produced 15 mL of alcohol during that run time. To establish the stability of the CEM electrolyzer, we conducted a test with the 5 cm2 cell over a longer duration. The system maintained a total alcohol FE of 35 at a full-cell potential of around 2.4 V for more than 100 hours Fig. 4E and Supplementary Table 15.

To further validate the long-term operation of the large-scale electrolyzer, we operated the 800 cm2 electrolyzer for an additional 7.5 hours Supplementary Fig. 15 and Supplementary Table 16, which is the maximum allowable duration due to lab restrictions preventing the use of high CO ﬂow rates for longer durations. We observed no considerable changes in the catalyst structure or ionomer binder after this stability test Supplementary Figs. 16 and 17. We also observed no signiﬁcant degradation in alcohol FE or crossover, sup- porting the scalability of the CEM MEA for large-scale alcohol pro- duction from CO. Discussion We developed a scalable COR electrolyzer that produces CO2-derived alcohols with lower energy intensity. We found that the conventional AEM MEA diluted the alcohol products due to electroosmotic drag, which we mitigated by reversing the ion ﬂow using a CEM MEA to minimize alcohol crossover. Optimization tests on the CEM MEA demonstrated that increasing the CO ﬂow rate enhanced alcohol recovery, achieving over 85 recovery from the cathode side at con- centrations up to 6 wt.. Scaling to a 50 cm2 electrolyzer initially led to signiﬁcant product loss due to high feed gas ﬂow rates, which required us to add a second low-temperature condenser, which captured over 95 of alcohols from the gas phase. Experimental validation conﬁrmed concentrations up to 48 wt. using the second condenser. We achieved further scalability validation by operating an 800 cm2 elec- trolyzer, where most of the alcohols remained on the cathode side and were effectively extracted from the cathode outlet using a multi-stage condenser strategy. Additionally, the optimized CEM electrolyzer conﬁguration demonstrated more than 100 hours of stability when applied to the 5 cm2 cell, maintaining low alcohol crossover rates. This represents the largest COR cell to date, validating industrial-scale COR for alcohol production.

A PTFE dispersion was made by diluting 5 g of a commercial PTFE dispersion Sigma Aldrich, 665800 with 5 g of DI water. The slurry and dispersion were mixed, combined, and blade-coated onto a wet-proofed carbon paper Fuel Cell Earth MGL190, 50 wet proofed, 80190 T using a blade height of 0.6 mm.

The tests were all completed under ambient conditions. The cells were assembled by sandwiching a 254 μm-thick Naﬁon 1110 membrane Fuel CellStore in CEM experimentsora 40 μm-thickPiperION-A40-HCO3 membrane Versogen Inc. in AEM experiments between a cathode and a Ir-mixed, metal oxide coated titanium felt anode Magneto Special Anodes. The Naﬁon 1110 membrane was replaced by a Naﬁon 117 membrane for 800 cm2 experiments due to the limited availability of Naﬁon 1110 in larger sizes. Naﬁon 115 was also evaluated. The membranes were treated according to the supplier speciﬁcation. The 5 cm2 and 50 cm2 cells were sealed with a 250 μm silicone gasket on the cathode and a 116 viton o-ring on the anode side. The 800 cm2 cell was sealed with a 316 buna o-ring. To maintain proper cooling in the 800 cm2 electrolyzer, the electrolyte was circulated through a stainless-steel radiator with a fan, keeping the temperature constant at approximately 30 C, as monitored by inline thermocouples through- out the experiment. The CO stream was fed without humidiﬁcation to the cell at 50 sccm with a mass-ﬂow controller. Humidiﬁcation of the CO gas was not required, as the water transported through the membrane was sufﬁcient to support the COR reaction. A 1 M KOH anolyte was pre- pared by adding potassium hydroxide pellets BioShop, PHY202 with deionized water prior to each test. The 1 M KOH anolyte was supplied to the anode at 10 mLmin with a peristaltic pump from a 200 mL container. The electrochemical measurements were performed with a potentiostat Autolab PGSTAT204 equipped with a 10 A booster in galvanostatic mode or a power supply Magna-Power SL series 10 V 250 A programmable DC power supply.

The cathode liquid products were obtained using either a liquid-collector or gas condenser applied downstream to the cathode gas outlet. The liquid-collector was a vial containing 10 mL of DI water held at 0C with an ice bath, in which the cathode gas outlet was bubbled through to collect the liquid products.

The samples were diluted with D2O and DMSO was used as the internal standard. The analysis was performed with an Agilent DD2 500 spectrometer in water suppression mode.

Spinel cobalt oxides Co3O4 are promising NO3RR electrocatalysts, yet the exact NO hydrogenation mechanism remains unclear. Here, we integrate theoretical calculations and systematic experiments to reveal that the hydrogenation pathway is dictated by the coordination environment, which can be tuned via crystal facet engineering. Co3O4 nanoparticles enriched with 111 facets o-Co3O4 and 100 facets c-Co3O4 were synthesized to expose 4- and 6-coordinated Co sites, respectively. Theoretical results show that o-Co3O4 favors nitrogen-site hydrogenation NO NHO, while c-Co3O4 promotes oxygen-site hydrogenation NO NHO, leading to distinct rate-determining steps. This selectivity is experimentally supported by in situ spectroscopy, which detects the NH2OH intermediate exclusively on o-Co3O4. Consequently, o-Co3O4 achieves superior NO3RR performance, with a Faradaic efﬁciency of 99.4 and an NH3 yield rate of 12.8 mg h1 cm2 at 0.4 V. This work uncovers the coordination-governed mechanism of NO hydrogenation and establishes facet engineering as an effective strategy for directing reaction pathways in NO3RR.

This selective hydrogenation step is also central to emerging strategies for electrochemical co-reduction of NO3and CO2, where NH2OH can react with CO2-derived intermediates to produce alkylamines e.g., methylamine, a valuable feed- stock in the chemical industry. Despite signiﬁcant progress in NO3RR catalysts, the NO hydrogenation mechanism remains underexplored, with conﬂicting hypotheses about whether nitrogen or oxygen atoms serve as the primary hydrogenation site.1625 Cobalt-based materials have emerged as promising NO3RR electrocatalysts due to their high catalytic activity, ease of synthesis, and low cost compared to noble metals. Previous Co-based NO3RR studies have mainly focused on optimizing adsorption sites for NO3and NOx inter- mediates, enhancing NOx hydrogenation, and leveraging Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2025, e202508227 1 of 9 2025 Wiley-VCH GmbH Research Article cooperative effects between active sites to improve ammonia yield while suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction.23,2630 However, the speciﬁc hydrogenation mechanism of NO on Co-based catalysts remains largely unexplored. Both nitrogen-site NH and oxygen-site OH hydrogenation pathways are thermodynamically feasible and can lead to ammonia formation. To advance NO3RR catalyst design and optimize selectivity for NH3 and NH2OH, it is essential to systematically investigate the relative contributions of these competing hydrogenation pathways. In this work, we use spinel Co3O4 as a model electro- catalyst to investigate the selective hydrogenation site of the NO intermediate during NO3RR. Theoretical calculations ﬁrst identify the adsorption behavior of NO on two distinct crystal facets: 111 and 100. The results reveal that the 111 facet, with 4-coordinated Co sites, favors hydrogenation at the nitrogen site, forming NHO intermediate. In contrast, the 100 facet, with 6-coordinated Co sites, promotes oxygen-site hydrogenation, leading to NOH formation. To validate these ﬁndings, we synthesize Co3O4 nanoparticles with enriched 111 crystal facets noted as o-Co3O4 and 100 crystal facets noted as c-Co3O4 and analyze their reaction intermediates by in-situ Fourier transform infrared FTIR spectroscopy. The distinction in hydrogenation pathways is attributed to the difference in NO adsorption: NO binds in a bridged conﬁguration on 4-coordinated Co sites, whereas on 6- coordinated Co sites, it adopts an on-top adsorption mode. This variation affects electron donation from Co sites to NO, altering the charge density distribution between nitrogen and oxygen, which in turn dictates the preferred hydrogenation pathway. As a result, o-Co3O4 catalyst achieves a high Faradaic efﬁciency FE of 99.4 for NH3 at 0.4 V, with a corresponding NH3 yield rate of 12.8 mg NH3 h1 cm2. This study provides new insights into the role of cobalt coordination in NO hydrogenation, addressing discrepancies in prior research and guiding the design of selective NO3RR electrocatalysis.

This study provides new insights into the role of cobalt coordination in NO hydrogenation, addressing discrepancies in prior research and guiding the design of selective NO3RR electrocatalysis. Results and Discussion To elucidate the key factors underlying distinct hydrogenation pathways, o-Co3O4 and c-Co3O4 were selected as the model systems. As shown in Figure 1a,b, the cobalt coordination environment on the surfaces of o-Co3O4 and c-Co3O4 differs signiﬁcantly and causes distinct NO adsorption behaviors. The o-Co3O4 surface predominantly consists of tetrahedral Co, serving as NO adsorption sites. Upon exposing on the surface, the tetrahedral Co becomes tricoordinated and extruded out, which grants the tetrahedral Co sites mobility. As a result, once the NO approaches the surface, it drives the migration of the tetrahedral Co and forms the bridged adsorption conﬁguration. In contrast, the c-Co3O4 surface contains both tetrahedral and octahedral Co, with the latter primarily being responsible for NO adsorption. However, since the octahedral Co forms bonds with ﬁve lattice oxygens and is embedded in the surface, the NO is adsorbed on this site via an on-top conﬁguration. The distinct NO adsorption behaviors alter the reactivity of N and O toward hydrogen, thus, posing different hydrogenation pathways. As shown in the Figure 1c, the NO NHO pathway is more favorable for the bridged conﬁguration, as it exhibits a lower Gibbs free energy change G value of 0.17 eV, compared to that of 0.55 eV for the NO NHO pathway. However, for the on-top conﬁguration, the G of NO NHO pathway is 0.02 eV, signiﬁcantly lower than the 1.04 eV of the NO NHO pathway. To understand the principle behind the hydrogenation pathway selectivity, we conducted Bader charge analysis on NO of the two adsorption conﬁgurations Figure S1. Figure 1d shows that for the on-top conﬁguration, the NO molecule receives 0.23 electrons from the octahedral Co site, 0.06 electrons on N, and 0.17 electrons on O. In contrast, for the bridged conﬁguration, the two tetrahedral Co sites each provides 0.24 electrons to the NO molecule, which is also evenly distributed on N and O. Since N has a lower electronegativity than O, the excess accumulation of electrons to N on the bridged conﬁguration compared to the on-top one drives the change of hydrogenation site from O to N. The crystal orbital Hamilton populations COHP method was adopted to further clarify the hydrogenation pathway selectivity.31 Figure 1e shows the COHP results for the OH bond of the NOH intermediate and the NH bond of the NHO intermediate. The positive value of COHP indicates the bonding states, and the negative value indicates the anti-bonding states. The highest occupation energy level is indicated by the Fermi level, which is at 0 eV. The rule is that if more anti-bonding states of the bond are occupied, the bond is less stable.32 It is found that all examined bonds have their anti-bonding states being partially occupied,",

The rule is that if more anti-bonding states of the bond are occupied, the bond is less stable.32 It is found that all examined bonds have their anti-bonding states being partially occupied, except for the NH bond on o-NHO, i.e., NHO intermediate on the o-Co3O4 surface. The area for the occupied anti-bonding states was calculated to be 0.047, 0.063, and 0.012 eV for the OH bond on o-NOH, the NH bond on c-NHO, and the OH bond on c-NOH, respectively. Therefore, from the COHP analysis, it is also concluded that NO on the bridged conﬁguration tends to be hydrogenated on the N site, while NO on the on-top conﬁguration tends to be hydrogenated on the O site. These results suggest that the coordination environment of Co sites on Co3O4 surface signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the adsorp- tion conﬁguration of the NO and then the hydrogenation pathways. To experimentally validate the predicted hydrogenation pathways, Co3O4 nanostructures with exposed 100 and 111 facets were prepared by two-step synthesis strategy Figure S2. Speciﬁcally, c-Co3O4 and o-Co3O4 samples were fabricated by ﬁrst adjusting the reactant ratio via a solvothermal method to obtain the precursor, followed by annealing. X-ray diffraction XRD conﬁrmed the phase purity of both c-Co3O4 and o-Co3O4, with diffraction peaks matching the standard Co3O4 reference JCPDS No.742120 at 19.0, 31.3, 36.8, 44.8, 59.3, and 65.2 Figure 2a.

In the high-resolution Co 2p XPS spectra Figure 3a, the yellow peaks at 779.9 and 795.2 eV correspond to Co 2p32 and Co 2p12 peaks of Co3, respec- tively, while the blue peaks at 781.7 and 797.1 eV are attributed to Co2.26,33 In the O 1s spectrum Figure 3b, the peak at 529.9 eV corresponds to lattice oxygen Olatt from Co3O4, while the peaks at 531.8 and 533.3 eV are assigned to adsorbed hydroxyl groups OH and water H2O, respectively.33,34 The ratio of OOHH2OOlatt in o- Co3O4 was signiﬁcantly higher than in c-Co3O4, indicating a greater surface coverage of adsorbed oxygen species. Therefore, the higher adsorbed oxygen in o-Co3O4 is expected to enhance NO3RR performance. To further analyze the electronic structure and coordination environment, X-ray absorption near-edge structure XANES and extended X- ray absorption ﬁne structure EXAFS spectroscopy were performed. The Co K-edge XANES analysis revealed that the absorption edges of o-Co3O4 and c-Co3O4 are nearly identical, which exhibit similarities to the reference Co3O4 but signiﬁcant differences from the CoO reference and Co foil Figure 3c, indicating that o-Co3O4 and c-Co3O4 have similar electronic structures.34,35 The EXAFS spectra in R- space revealed that both samples exhibited vibration patterns similar to the Co3O4 reference Figure 3d, with main peaks at 1.2 and 2.4 Å corresponding to CoO and CoCo Angew.

The NO3RR performance of the as-prepared catalyst was evaluated in a conventional H-type electrolytic cell using a three-electrode conﬁguration under ambient conditions. As shown in Figure 4a, the linear sweep voltammetry LSV was performed in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with and without 0.1 M KNO3 at a scan rate of 5 mV s1 without iR-compensation. The current density increased signiﬁcantly with the addition of 0.1 M KNO3, conﬁrming the occurrence of NO3RR. Notably, o-Co3O4 exhibited a higher current density than c- Co3O4 across all tested potentials. The standard curve for quantifying NH3 concentration, obtained using colorimetric methods, is presented in Figure S5. Chronoamperometry tests were conducted for 1 h in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with 0.1 M KNO3, with potentials ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 V versus RHE Figure S6.

To conﬁrm that NH3 originated from NO3RR, control experiments were performed in electrolytes without NO3and under open circuit potential OCP conditions Figure S8, yielding negligible NH3 production. Further validation using a 15N isotope-labeling experiment demonstrated characteristic double peaks for 15NH4 when 15NO3was used as the nitrogen source, while 14NH4 triplet peaks were observed with 14NO3Figure 4e, conﬁrming that NH3 was derived from NO3reduction. The NH3 yield and FE obtained from 1H nuclear magnetic resonance NMR spectroscopy closely matched those measured by UVvis spectroscopy, verifying quantiﬁcation accuracy Figure 4f.48 To investigate the factors contributing to the superior activity of o-Co3O4, the electrochemical surface area ECSA was assessed by measuring double-layer capacitance Cdl, which correlates with active site density Figure S9. The similar ECSA values of o-Co3O4 and c-Co3O4 indicate comparable numbers of active sites. The catalytic activity nor- malized by ECSA demonstrates a signiﬁcantly higher intrinsic activity for o-Co3O4 compared to c-Co3O4 Figure S10 11. Furthermore, EIS was conducted to examine NO3RR electron transfer kinetics. As shown in Figure S12, two catalysts exhibit a similar solution resistance Rs of about 3.4 , but a signiﬁcantly distinct charge transfer resistance Rct. c-Co3O4 shows lower charge transfer resistances than o-Co3O4 at various potentials, indicating the faster electron transfer kinetics of NO3RR on o-Co3O4. Such difference in reaction kinetics can lead to the divergent ammonia yield rates between two catalysts. Beyond the catalytic activity, durability plays a pivotal role in evaluating the overall catalytic performance. Chronoamperometric measurement at 0.4 V for 30 h reveals no signiﬁcant decrease in current density Figure 4g. To further assess the structural stability, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy HRTEM and XRD characterizations were conducted after the stability test, conﬁrming the presence of 111 facets at the catalyst surface and a well-preserved 111400 intensity Angew.

Meanwhile, the NH3 yield rates and FEs of o-Co3O4 exhibit negligible degradation over 30 consecutive cycles at 0.4 V Figure 4h. The slight FEs increase during the initial cycles is due to the improved catalyst surface wettability Figure S14. The above experimental result demonstrates that o-Co3O4 has high intrinsic active site and excellent stability. In situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy FTIR tests at different potentials were conducted to monitor the reaction intermediates Figure S15. The peaks at 1685, 1342, 1589, and 1101 cm1 correspond to H2O, NO3, NH4, NO2, and NH2, respectively Figures 5a,b and S16. Notably, the NO2 peak is downward-facing, likely due to the consumption rate of NO2exceeding its production rate.29,4951 Interestingly, the adsorption modes of NO differ between o-Co3O4 and c-Co3O4, with o-Co3O4 exhibiting bridge adsorption 1539 cm1, while c-Co3O4 shows an on-top conﬁguration 1385 cm1.49,52,53 Additionally, the appearance of the NOH 1355 cm1 intermediate on c- Co3O4 indicates that the reaction follows an oxygen-terminal hydrogenation pathway.54,55 The in situ FTIR spectra of o-Co3O4 and c-Co3O4 are similar, but o-Co3O4 exhibits a distinct peak at 1160 cm1, which corresponds to the NH2OH intermediate, absent in c-Co3O4.56,57 Online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry DEMS was then applied to capture the possible intermediates and products. The mz signals of 46, 30, 17, and 16 corresponding to NO2, NO, NH3, and NH2 were recorded for both o-Co3O4 and c-Co3O4 Figure S17. Notably, the NH2OH signal mz of 33 was present on o-Co3O4 but absent on c-Co3O4. NH2OH is the key intermediate that determines whether the reaction pathway is NOH or NHO. This observation suggests that o- Co3O4 follows the NHO pathway while c-Co3O4 undergoes the NOH pathway to produce NH3. Angew. Chem. Int.

As shown in Figure S18, near the Fermi energy level, the total density of states TDOS is primarily attributed to the 3d orbitals of Co, which can be explained by the d- band center theory.

The d-band center εd is a key descriptor for evaluating the electrocatalytic activity. As depicted in Figure 5c, εd for o-Co3O4 is 1.249 eV, while for c-Co3O4 is 1.382 eV. The closer proximity of o-Co3O4s εd to the Fermi level EF ensures a more efﬁcient electron transfer process on its surface. Consequently, the adsorption and activation of key intermediates were enhanced during the NO3RR process, ultimately leading to improved catalytic activity of o-Co3O4. It is well established that NO3adsorption plays a critical role in the NO3RR progress. Figure S19 shows that the two O atoms in NO3are adsorbed onto the two Co atoms in both o-Co3O4 and c-Co3O4. The adsorption energy of NO3 is 0.32 eV on o-Co3O4 and 0.11 eV on c-Co3O4. This indicates that o-Co3O4 is thermodynamically more favorable for NO3adsorption, facilitating the easier progression of the NO3RR. Subsequently, the hydrogen evolution reaction HER energy barriers were calculated for both catalysts Figure S20. As shown in Figure 5d, GH values of the two catalysts are similar, with o-Co3O4 performing slightly better. This indicates that o-Co3O4 is less prone to hydrogen evolution and more effective at suppressing side reactions, leading to superior NO3RR activity. As shown in Figure 1c and o-Co3O4 follows the NHO pathway, while c- Co3O4 follows the NOH pathway. The free energy of each intermediate was calculated in Figure 5e. The corresponding intermediate adsorption conﬁgurations are shown in Figure S21 and S22. For o-Co3O4, the energy barrier for NO hydrogenation to form NHO is 0.17 eV, identiﬁed as the rate-determining step RDS. In contrast, for c-Co3O4, the RDS is NOH deoxygenation to form N, with an energy barrier of 0.89 eV, signiﬁcantly higher than that of o-Co3O4. Combined with EIS analysis of charge transfer resistance, the lower energy barrier of the RDS on o-Co3O4 indicates faster reaction kinetics compared to c-Co3O4, leading to their distinct ammonia yield rates despite similar Faradaic efﬁciencies. Except for RDS, all other reaction steps for both catalysts are downhill, promoting the favorable adsorption of intermediates involved in the reaction. Therefore, FTIR and theoretical calculations demonstrated that different reaction pathways of o-Co3O4 and c-Co3O4, with o-Co3O4 exhibiting superior NO3RR activity. Conclusion In summary, we integrated both theoretical calculations and experimental approaches to elucidate how the coordination number CN of Co affects hydrogenation pathways in the NO3RR. We demonstrated that CN of Co can be regulated by changing the crystal facets of Co-based spinel Angew. Chem. Int.

Wu e202508227 Cobalt-Oxygen Coordination Steering NO Hydrogenation in Nitrate Electroreduction The hydrogenation pathway of the NO intermediate is a critical step determining the selectivity of hydroxylamine, yet current understanding remains limited. Studies reveal that the hydrogenation sites of the NO intermediate are governed by the cobalt coordination environment. Speciﬁcally, NO adsorbs in a bridged conﬁguration on 4-coordinate cobalt sites, which facilitates nitrogen-site hydrogenation, whereas it adsorbs in an on-top manner on 6-coordinate cobalt sites, promoting oxygen-site hydrogenation.

However, its practical feasibility remains hindered by large overpotentials, unsatisfactory selectivity, and inadequate durability. Here, we report a pH-asymmetric hybrid system of electrolysis AHSE to realize ampere-level, long-term alcohols electro-reﬁnery and parallel hydrogen production. By harnessing internal neutralization energy, the AHSE simultaneously produces benzoic acid Ph-COOH and hydrogen at a low electricity expense of 3.193.78 kWh per m3 H2 at 500 mA cm2, saving 24.630.6 energy than pH-symmetric systems. The operational stability is maximized by independent optimization of pH conditions at the anode and cathode, allowing for continuous operation over 4100 h at large current densities of 5001000 mA cm2. High Faradaic eﬃciency FE of 91.397.7 is reached for benzyl alcohol BA conversion, with 78.595.5 Ph-COOH selectivity. When scaled up 100 folds, the AHSE retains over 85 FE for BA conversion and 88.5 Ph-COOH selectivity while yielding hydrogen at a fast rate of 18.7 L h1 at an ultra-high current of 50 A at 3.14 V. 1. Introduction Water electrolysis represents the most eﬃcient pathway for green hydrogen production as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels.1 However, this technology demands substantial freshwater re- sources, which are both limited and unevenly distributed world- wide.

The resulting hybrid water electrolysis systems not only avoid chloride-induced anode corrosion but also gen- erate value-added chemicals to oﬀset hydrogen costs.15 The electrocatalytic conversion of various organics, including alco- hols, aldehydes, amides, and alkenes, has been explored to en- hance the energy eﬃciency and cost-eﬀectiveness of hydrogen production.1621 However, its practical feasibility remains hin- dered by high overpotentials, unsatisfactory selectivity, and lim- ited durability, arising from complex reaction pathways involving multi-proton-coupled electron transfers and uncontrolled side re- actions. For instance, alcohol oxidation reactions AOR theoret- ically enable substantial energy savings due to their low thermo- dynamic potentials 0.3 V.2226 However, this beneﬁt is dimin- ished by high overpotentials 0.70.8 V and sluggish kinetics associated with multi-step dehydrogenation and carbonylation Adv.

Consequently, elec- trolysis lifespan remains limited to less than 400500 h at current densities below 500 mA cm2, falling short of meeting industrial demands.2730 The Nernst equation ΔG zFEMF suggests that internal chemical energy can be harnessed to reduce the energy demands of water electrolysis.31,32 For example, the neutralization energy of the acid-base reaction H OHH2O releases a reaction heat ΔH𝜃 of 55.83 kJ mol1 at 298.15 K. Notably, this spon- taneous reaction also exhibits a positive entropic heat TΔS𝜃 24.05 kJ mol1, 298.15 K, allowing heat extraction from not only the reaction itself but also the surrounding environment to drive electrical work.33,34 A sum of these energy contributes to a to- tal Gibbs free energy change of 79.88 kJ mol1 at 298.15 K, po- tentially reducing the electrolysis voltage by 0.828 V under a pH gradient of 14 between the anode and cathode.31,33 Meanwhile, acidic and alkaline waste constitutes major industrial sewage, with global discharge exceeding billion tons annually. Their neu- tralization theoretically releases over 1200 TWh of energy, trans- lating to 1721 megatons of hydrogen beyond the International Energy Agencys IEA 2030 target for low-carbon hydrogen pro- duction 17 megatons.32 Thus, utilization of the acid-base neu- tralization energy presents a promising strategy for cost-eﬀective hydron production while addressing the environmental hazards of corrosive and toxic pollutants. Herein, we report an asymmetric hybrid system of electrol- ysis AHSE for harnessing neutralization energy to overcome the high overpotential obstacle in an electrocatalytic reﬁnery.

As a demonstration of the eﬃcacy of the system in electro-reﬁnery, the AOR is employed due to its potential for producing value- added derivatives such as aldehydes and carboxylic acids.35,36 By integrating a Co-doped Ni2P electrode as the anode in AHSE, ef- ﬁcient hydrogen production is achieved alongside benzyl alcohol BA conversion to benzoic acid Ph-COOH with high selectiv- ity at a low voltage of ca. 1.452.2 V without iR correction un- der industrial-level current densities of 5001000 mA cm2 for 4,100 h. The 100 fold scaled AHSE reaches a high FE of 90 for hydrogen production and over 88 selectivity for Ph-COOH generation at an ultra-high current of 50 A. 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Fabrication of Co-Ni2PNF Electrode A Co-doped Ni2P electrode Co-Ni2PNF is made by phospha- tization of Co-doped NiOH2 nanosheet arrays on nickel foam NF to lower the intrinsic overpotential of BA oxidation reaction BOR in alkaline medium Figure 1a,b; Figure S1a, Supporting Information. EDS mapping conﬁrms the existence of Co, Ni, and P elements in Co-Ni2P with a Co doping amount of 9.9 wt. Figure 1c. Doping of Co with a larger atomic radius induces a slight shift of diﬀraction peak from the 111, 201, and 210 plane of Ni2P toward lower angles in XRD patterns, leading to a lattice expansion of ca. 0.18, 0.2 and 0.21 along these di- rections, respectively Figure 1d. This accompanies charge redis- tribution via electron transfer from Co to neighboring Ni, as evi- denced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS spectra, where the peaks from the NiP bond negatively shift by 0.35 eV, while the peaks of the CoP bond move to the opposite direction by 0.39 eV relative to undoped samples Figure 1ef. Additionally, the O 1s XPS spectra reveal that surface oxide species on Co- Ni2P are mainly P-O and metal-OH, whereas undoped Ni2P ex- hibits merely P-O species Figure S2, Supporting Information. X-ray absorption near-edge structure XANES spectra verify that both Ni and Co in Co-Ni2P adopt valence states ranging from 0 to 2 Figure 1g,h. Compared to the undoped sample, the Ni absorption edge of Co-Ni2P shifts to lower energy while the Co absorption edge moves to higher energy, indicating charge trans- fer from Co dopant to Ni. Fourier-transform extended XAFS FT- EXAFS spectra and ﬁtting data further reveal that charge redis- tribution and localized lattice tensile induced by Co doping ex- tend the NiP bond length from 2.19 Å in Ni2P to 2.22 Å upon Co doping Figure 1i,j; Figures S3 and S4, Tables S1 and S2, Support- ing Information. These eﬀects upshift the d-band center of Ni and weaken NiP bonds Figure S1b, Supporting Information, thereby facilitating surface hydroxylation of Co-Ni2P to form ac- tive intermediates such as NiOOH upon electrochemical oxida- tion, which in turn promotes BOR.37 The absence of CoCo",

BOR Performance of Co-Ni2PNF Electrode The intrinsic BOR activity of the Co-Ni2PNF electrode is as- sessed in 1.0 M KOH containing 0.1 M BA, with all potentials referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode RHE unless oth- erwise speciﬁed. For comparison, benchmark electrodes, includ- ing Ni2PNF and Co2PNF, are prepared by loading Ni2P or Co2P onto NF, respectively. The active mass loading is ca. 1.7 mg cm2 for all electrodes. The undoped Ni2PNF exhibits a greatly lower potential 1.39 V than Co2PNF 1.53 V at a current density of 500 mA cm2, indicating the limited activity of Co2P for BOR. However, its BOR activity remains unsatisfactory, particularly at high current densities, due to the sluggish formation of active 𝛾- NiOOH intermediate and limited reactant adsorption. Co-doping Ni: Co 9: 1 further reduces the potential for BOR to 1.35 V at 500 mA cm2 Figure 2a. This performance surpasses that of reported BOR electrocatalysts, which typically operate at lower current densities e.g., 100 mA cm2 while requiring higher po- tentials 1.361.55 VFigure 2b; Table S3, Supporting Informa- tion. Excess Co doping e.g., Ni: Co 4: 1 reduces the concen- tration of Ni sites and suppresses 𝛾-NiOOH generation, thereby compromising BOR activity at large current densities. The Co- Ni2PNF electrode exhibits high selectivity toward BOR even at high current density, reﬂected by its signiﬁcantly higher poten- tial of 1.67 V for OER at 500 mA cm2 in 1.0 M KOH Figure 2c. This electrode exhibits high stability toward BOR for 120 h at 500 mA cm2, maintaining much lower potentials than OER Figure 2d. After BOR, inductively coupled plasma optical emis- sion spectroscopy ICP-OES analysis reveals minimal leaching of Ni and Co from the Co-Ni2P detached from the NF Table S4, Supporting Information, demonstrating its high structural and chemical stability. The gradual potential rise from 1.6 to 1.75 V without iR correction every 40 h is due to BA depletion in the Adv. Funct.

Raman spectroscopy analyses are performed on Co-Ni2PNF dur- ing BOR. As the applied potential exceeds 1.4 V, two bands appear at 457 and 535 cm1, which gradually shift to 465 and 544 cm1 with increasing intensity until 1.7 V, respectively Figure 3a. The Raman shift and relative intensity ratio of these two peaks closely align with the eg bending vibration 𝛿NiIII-O and A1g stretch- ing vibration 𝜈NiIII-O of 𝛾-NiOOH.38,39 Due to the chemical interaction between BA and 𝛾-NiOOH, these vibrational bands undergo a redshift compared to the OER case Figure S8a, Sup- porting Information.40,41 Upon returning to open-circuit poten- tial OCP, the bands of 𝛾-NiOOH disappear, conﬁrming that 𝛾- NiOOH acts as the active phase for catalyzing alkaline BOR. No Raman signals from 𝛾-NiOOH are detected on Ni2PNF during BOR up to 1.7 V in 1.0 M KOH containing 0.1 M BA Figure 3a. However, the 𝛾-NiOOH bands appear when BA concentration falls below 0.06 M at a ﬁxed potential of 1.6 V Figure S8b, Supporting Information. This observation indicates rapid con- sumption of 𝛾-NiOOH once formed on Ni2PNF, thereby lim- iting its BOR activity and selectivity at large current densities. In situ Fourier-transform infrared reﬂection FT-IR spectra fur- ther validate 𝛾-NiOOH formation on Co-Ni2P above 1.4 V, ev- idenced by the rise of hydroxyl stretching vibration bands at 36003720 cm1, whereas Ni2P surface maintains unchanged Figure 3b.42 These ﬁndings suggest that 𝛾-NiOOH acts as the active phase for catalyzing alkaline BOR on both Co-Ni2P and un- doped Ni2P. However, Co doping promotes 𝛾-NiOOH generation at lower potentials and a faster rate that outpaces its consump- tion, thereby enhancing BOR performance, particularly selectiv- ity. This eﬀect arises from the lower oxidation state of Ni and elon- gated NiP bond length induced by Co doping, which enhances the activity of Ni sites toward surface hydroxylation during alka- line BOR. To validate the enhanced 𝛾-NiOOH formation on Co-Ni2P, cyclic voltammetry CV tests are conducted in the absence of BA to eliminate its reductive eﬀect on 𝛾-NiOOH. Signiﬁcantly reduced potential barrier and improved kinetics of 𝛾-NiOOH for- mation on Co-Ni2PNF are reﬂected by a stronger redox peak, with more than twice higher oxidation charge density at a lower Adv.

The beneﬁcial role of Co doping in promoting 𝛾- NiOOH formation and enhancing BOR activity is further vali- dated by in-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy EIS. In the Bode plots, the low-frequency region 0.110 Hz cor- responds to interfacial charge transfer during BOR, while the high-frequency region 101000 Hz is associated with charge transfer associated with NiOHx electro-oxidation to 𝛾-NiOOH Figure 3c,d.28,43 As the potential rises from 1.2 to 1.5 V, the Co- Ni2PNF exhibits a signiﬁcantly faster decline of phase angle in both frequency regions relative to Ni2PNF, indicating superior kinetics for both 𝛾-NiOOH formation and BOR. Since 𝛾-NiOOH formation initiates via OHattack to NiOHx NiOHx OH𝛾-NiOOH H2O e, the OHadsorp- tion capability of the electrodes is crucial for accelerating 𝛾- NiOOH generation.

On Co-NiOOH, the subsequent carbonylation step Ph-CH2O OHPh-CHO H2O e, ΔG 1.04 eV presents the primary energy barrier, followed by a relatively moderate uphill hydration step Ph-CHO H2O Ph-CHOH2, ΔG 0.38 eV. Thus, the carbonylation of Ph-CH2OH to Ph-CHO is identiﬁed as the rate-determining step RDS in BOR on Co-NiOOH. Whereas on NiOOH, both the carbonylation of Ph-CH2O to Ph-CHO and the subsequent hydration to Ph-CHOH2 remain thermodynamically unfavor- able, with the latter step being more endothermic ΔG 2.03 eV. This high energy barrier impedes the overall reaction and pro- motes the undesired formation of Ph-CHO to reduce Ph-COOH selectivity. Shifting the RDS from a slow surface chemical trans- formation to a more eﬃcient electrochemical step substantially enables faster reaction kinetics and precise control over the re- action pathway. This mechanistic advantage accounts for the sig- niﬁcantly enhanced BOR performance of Co-Ni2P, particularly its Ph-COOH selectivity at large current densities. 2.4. AHSE Performance for Ampere-Level Hydrogen and Ph-COOH Production An AHSE is engineered by integrating acidic HER in seawater at the cathode with alkaline BOR at the anode. This conﬁgura- tion exploits the pH gradient between the acidic catholyte and alkaline anolyte to generate and harvest internal neutralization energy, eﬀectively lowering the electricity demand for electrol- ysis Figure 4a.

This potential reduction is close to the theoretical value of 0.828 V at a pH gradient of 14, showing 83.3 utilization of internal neu- tralization energy in AHSE. The AHSE can further cut cell volt- age by 1.1 V to reduce electricity expense by 39.248.7 relative to alkaline water electrolysis AWE. During long-term operation, the AHSE exhibits average cell voltages of 1.321.58 V without iR correction at 500 mA cm2 and 1.982.45 V without iR correction at twice higher current density of 1,000 mA cm2 for 4100 h Figure 4c. Periodic volt- age ﬂuctuations observed during durability tests are attributed to scheduled electrolyte replenishment. The FE of anodic BOR re- mains ca. 97.7 at 500 mA cm2 and ca. 91.3 at 1,000 mA cm2 with Ph-COOH selectivity of ca. 95.5 and ca.78.5 on average, respectively. The decline in Ph-COOH selectivity with increasing current density is attributed to the enhanced formation of Ph- CHO as a by-product, as conﬁrmed by HPLC analysis at various charge inputs at 5001000 mA cm2 Figure S16, Supporting In- formation. This increase in Ph-CHO yield arises from the kineti- cally accelerated electrochemical conversion of Ph-CH2O to Ph- CHO at higher current densities Figure 3j.

BA is a key industrial feedstock with annual global produc- tion exceeding 305000 tons.47 It is widely used in coatings, fragrances, and pharmaceuticals, which often discharge waste steam containing high BA residue over 14 g L1.48 This concen- tration is roughly equivalent to 0.12 M, aligning well with the substrate requirement of AHSE. Utilizing BA-containing waste as a low-cost feedstock for AHSE thus presents an economi- cally viable approach for cost-eﬀective hydrogen and Ph-COOH production with added environmental beneﬁts. A rough techno- economic analysis TEA suggests that the hydrogen cost via AHSE is expected to be reduced to 0.11 per m3 H2, achieving 60 of the U.S. Department of Energy DOE 2026 target, assum- ing the use of BA-containing waste Figure 4f; Table S7, Sup- porting Information.49 It estimates a cost of 1179.86 ton1 for Ph-COOH production, which is potentially reduced to 72.96 ton1 if assuming waste streams containing BA are used as feed- stock. These values compare favorably with conventional liquid- phase oxidation of toluene to Ph-COOH at a higher cost of 1448.88 ton1 under high temperature and pressure. Moreover, low toluene conversion 70 of the conventional route causes considerable separation costs for unreacted toluene. In contrast, the electro-synthesis approach oﬀers near-quantitative BA con- version with electricity input, signiﬁcantly enhancing processing eﬃciency. The upgradation of BA into value-added chemicals po- tentially oﬀsets 57.8 of the electricity cost, reducing hydrogen production expense by 59.4 compared to AWE. On this basis, capturing the huge neutralization energy of acid and alkaline wastewater through AHSE may unlock further economic and en- vironmental beneﬁts, advancing sustainable hydrogen produc- tion and ﬁne chemical synthesis. 3. Conclusion An asymmetric hybrid system of electrolysis is engineered by in- tegrating acidic HER in seawater with alkaline BOR, eﬀectively harnessing internal neutralization energy for energy-saving hy- drogen and benzoic acid production. Utilizing a Co-doped Ni2P- based electrode, the system achieves an FE of 95.798.3 for al- kaline BOR with high Ph-COOH selectivity of 95.497.4 in a potential range of 1.41.8 V. Mechanistic analysis reveals that Co doping plays a vital role in enhancing BOR by promoting the for- mation of 𝛾-NiOOH as an active intermediate toward BOR, facil- itating interfacial charge transfer while shifting the rate-limiting step from the sluggish chemical hydration of Ph-CHO to ef- ﬁcient electrochemical carbonylation of Ph-CH2O. The AHSE signiﬁcantly reduces electricity consumption to 3.193.78 kWh per m3 H2, enabling simultaneous hydrogen and benzoic acid production at a low cell voltage of 0.98 V at 500 mA cm2. The system exhibits exceptional durability for 4,100 h stable electrol- ysis with 91.397.7 FE for BOR at industrial-level current den- sities of 5001000 mA cm2. Upon scaling up for 100 folds, the AHSE operates at an ultra-high current of 50 A, achieving a hy- drogen production rate of 18.7 L h1 and a benzyl alcohol con- version rate",

This study draws inspiration from desert-dwelling lizards to design a flow-field that increases the performance of the CO2RR in a zero-gap CO2 electrolyzer. It achieves a CO partial current density of 165.5 mA cm2 at 200 mA cm2, surpassing those of conventional parallel and serpentine flow-field designs. Unlike more complex strategies that can only partially prevent water flooding or salt precipitation, our approach achieves both, solely by modifying the cathodic flow-field, while using commercial electrocatalysts, membranes, and standard operating conditions. When doubling the cell size, the lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field significantly boosts CO production: CO selectivity is 46 and 97 higher than for a conventional serpentine flow-field at 350 mA cm2 and 400 mA cm2, respectively. Thus, lizard-inspired flow-field technology could provide a step-change in stable, scalable CO2RR, even using commercially available components for the use of CO2 electrolyzers. I n recent years, there has been growing interest in utilizing renewable energy to drive the electroreduction of carbon dioxide CO2RR, aiming to close the artificial carbon cycle and produce valuable chemicals and fuels.13 The incorporation of gas diffusion layers GDLs and a membrane electrode assembly MEA in the cell architecture of zero-gap CO2 electrolyzers allows this device to reach industrially relevant current densities 200 mA cm2 and selective conversion. GDLs enable high current densities by decreasing the diffusion length of CO2 from the gas phase to the surface of the MEA where catalysis occurs.4 However, the alkaline environment of this device promotes a pathway toward the formation of salt deposits onto the GDLs via the production of carbonates, which impedes CO2 transport to catalytic sites and enhances flooding of the cell, resulting in device failure.410 Strategies to alleviate flooding and salt precipitation in zero-gap CO2 electrolyzers with gas-fed cathodes include i modification of the concentration and composition of the electrolyte,1115 ii alteration of the properties of its cell components such as the GDL and the membrane,5,1620 iii pulsed electrolysis,2124 and iv optimization of the operating conditions.4,8,2528 An additional strategy to circumvent the flooding issue in such electrolyzers is proper modification of the flow-field design, which is a critical but elusive aspect. Flow-field design significantly affects the reactant distribution and mass transport within the electrolyzer.29 A well-designed flow-field ensures uniform delivery of CO2 to the catalyst surface, which enhances its accessibility to catalytic sites, improving the selectivity and yield of the desired products. Recent studies have underscored the significance of flow-field optimization in enhancing CO2 electrolyzer performance.18,30 For instance, interdigitated flow-fields exhibit 45 mA cm2 higher CO2RR current density than their serpentine counter- parts at a gas flow rate of 6 sccm, indicating more efficient",

Preliminary results demonstrate that a 50 cm2 spiral flow-field with unidirectional and uniform distribution UDF enhances the mass transport of CO2 to the surface of the MEA and, thus, the production rate of CO maintaining a low pressure drop 6 kPa.33 Herein, we employ our nature-inspired chemical engineering NICE methodology32,3437 to design new flow-fields for zero- gap CO2 electrolyzers, boosting their efficiency via optimized structural features of the flow-fields Figure 1. The NICE approach is based on the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms underpinning desired properties in biological organisms and their implementation in technological applica- tions, without neglecting the differences in context between nature and technology.32,3437 The flow-field design for CO2 electrolyzers herein draws inspiration from desert-dwelling lizards, such as the Australian thorny devil and Texan horned lizard, which possess intricate networks of capillary channels in their integument that facilitate passive water transport.36,37 The lizard-inspired flow-field is designed to improve water manage- ment and enhance mass transport in electrochemical devi- ces;36,37 recently, it has been implemented into polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells PEMFCs showcasing a stable, flood-free operation at 100 relative humidity RH and scalability.36,37 These results suggest that such a lizard-inspired design might also be a promising candidate for the elimination of water flooding and salt precipitation in zero-gap CO2 electro- lyzers. The capillary-driven water transport mechanism used by lizards is implemented by creating capillaries directly on the surface of conventional flow-fields in a zero-gap CO2 electro- lyzer. The water transport mechanism, driven by capillary action in the desert-dwelling lizards integument, remains effective when scaled up, as confirmed by quantitative analysis",

The capillary-driven water transport mechanism used by lizards is implemented by creating capillaries directly on the surface of conventional flow-fields in a zero-gap CO2 electro- lyzer. The water transport mechanism, driven by capillary action in the desert-dwelling lizards integument, remains effective when scaled up, as confirmed by quantitative analysis showing that capillary forces dominate over gravitational and viscous forces.37 In our design, hydrophilic capillaries are laser-engraved directly onto the surface of a serpentine flow-field Section S1.3, which is widely used due to its higher pressure drop compared to a parallel flow-field, allowing the continuous transport of reactants through the GDL to the electrocatalyst and ensuring good catalyst utilization.5,38 The positive impact of this design on the wettability of the surface of the flow-field was initially demonstrated via contact angle CA measurements. A water droplet 60 CA on the surface of a lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field rapidly permeates through its structure Video S1, whereas it remains stagnant 90 CA on the surface of a conventional serpentine flow-field, demonstrating that this nature-inspired design effectively enhances passive water transport in the flow-field. Based on these initial promising results, we compare the efficiency and operational stability of a lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field against conventional parallel and serpentine flow-field based CO2 electrolyzers. X- ray microcomputed tomography micro-CT is utilized to gain deeper insights into the electrochemical and structural dynamics within the different flow-fields. Three distinct flow-fields parallel, serpentine, and lizard- inspired serpentine were employed at the cathode side of a zero-gap CO2 electrolyzer to evaluate changes in activity and selectivity of CO2RR on an Ag gas diffusion electrode GDE at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. CO2RR was conducted at discrete current densities: 20, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 mA cm2, with each point held for 20 min under steady-state conditions on electrodes with a geometric area of Figure 1.

Analysis of the HFR suggests that the increase in voltage e.g., 3.76 V for serpentine vs 3.70 V for a lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field at 250 mA cm2 in Figure 2a is attributed to a higher HFR e.g., 0.71 Ω cm2 for serpentine vs 0.45 Ω cm2 for a lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field at 250 mA cm2 in Figure S4c and potential degradation of the membrane, exacerbated at higher current densities.39,40 The disparity in FECO between serpentine and lizard-inspired serpentine flow- fields Figure 2d is likely due to mechanical stress on the membrane during electrolysis, which is an additional result of membrane dehydration.39 Figure S4b illustrates more significant differences in the Nyquist plots among the different flow-fields, particularly at low frequencies. The low-frequency resistance dominates at low current densities but decreases significantly with increasing current density, suggesting that a substantial portion is related to charge transfer resistance Figure S4d.39 The lower charge transfer resistance of a lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field compared to a serpentine flow-field at higher current densities reflects enhanced charge transferability, and reduced polarization losses during CO2RR.41,42 To evaluate the stability of these zero-gap CO2 electrolyzers, the CO2RR was conducted over 24 h at 200 mA cm2 Figure Figure 2. a Cell voltage, b average partial current density of CO, c energy efficiency of CO production, and d total Faradaic efficiency CO-bottom bars, H2-top bars for parallel, serpentine, and lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field based CO2 electrolyzers.

As the CO2RR progresses, only the lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field maintains a stable cell voltage 3.5 V and CO selectivity 81.3 throughout the operation of the device Figure 3b, indicating that CO2 has access to the catalytic sites of the MEA and, thus, flooding is avoided. On the contrary, in the case of parallel and serpentine flow-fields, there is a gradual increase in cell voltage accompanied by a decrease in CO selectivity. After 10 h of operation, there is a sudden drop of the cell voltage for the parallel flow-field, coinciding with a drastic reduction in CO selectivity to 6.4 due to salt precipitation Figure 3d and flooding, boosting H2 selectivity to 50 Figure 3c. The parallel flow-field fails to operate past this point. For the serpentine flow-field, the cell voltage increases steadily over the first 22 h and then decreases, suggesting local membrane- electrode delamination or electrolyte breakthrough, likely induced by severe salt accumulation. This voltage collapse is accompanied by a reduction in CO selectivity of 21 after 24 h of operation, along with increased H2 selectivity 20, consistent with performance losses due to flooding and salt blockage, which is clearly visible on the back of the cathode side of the Ag GDEs post electrolysis Figure 3d. XRD measurements Figure S5 of Ag GDEs show that the crystallographic planes of Ag remain unchanged after CO2 electrolysis,43 while the emergence of additional peaks marked with blue diamonds indicates the formation of KHCO3 during the reaction of hydrogen peroxide, a byproduct of CO2RR, with the anolyte.8 The presence of Ag and K on Ag GDEs is also confirmed by SEM Figure S6. The formation of salt precipitates within the GDE poses a significant challenge to the stable operation of zero-gap electrolyzers with an alkaline anolyte. A higher concentration of K leads to a reduction in FECO due to an increase in the electro-osmotic drag of water, exacerbating flooding of the cathode and resulting in increased mass transport limitations for CO2RR.7 Micro-CT imaging was employed to quantitatively evaluate the salt precipitation on all flow-fields after durability measurement Figure S7. The minimal Ag presence in the fresh GDE is due to the initial infiltration of Ag nanoparticles during electrode preparation. In contrast, increased brightness is highlighted in the GDLs post electrolysis, indicating localized accumulation of K, likely resulting from uneven distribution of reactants. However, compared to the lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field with only few bright spots, the parallel and serpentine flow-fields show widespread and uneven accumulation of K. A field-of-view of 300 300 200 voxel in x-y-z orientation, with an isotropic voxel size of approximately 1.78 μm, was selected for material segmentation of micro-CT images Figure S8.

A relatively loose layer of dispersed Ag particles is present on fresh GDE Figure 4a. Notably, a significantly higher number of precipitates is observed within the GDEs mounted on parallel and serpentine flow-fields compared to the GDE on lizard- inspired serpentine flow-field, suggesting greater potassium salt accumulation in the GDL pores, which impedes CO2 transport to the catalytic sites Figure 4a.44 The GDL on the serpentine flow-field contains the highest amount of salt precipitates Figure 4b-c, with their quantities in the GDLs for the parallel, serpentine, and lizard-inspired serpentine flow-fields being 149, 377, and 72, respectively. Specifically, at a depth between 100200 μm, the metal fraction in the Ag GDE of the serpentine flow-field reaches 610, while in the lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field it remains below 1. Even though the parallel flow-field operates flood-free for 10 h, severe salt precipitation and significant flooding occurs thereafter, as indicated by the faults observed in the GDL Figure S8b, Figure S9b. Additionally, the lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field shows significantly fewer large precipitates within the GDL compared to the parallel and serpentine flow fields Figure 4c. A histogram of the size distribution of metal Ag or Ag and K within the GDL depth: 100350 μm of these flow-fields was constructed, revealing that the number of precipitates larger than 1000 μm3 is 19 in the parallel flow-field, 36 in the serpentine flow-field, and only 6 in the lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field Figure 4c. These observations indicate increased potassium salt precipitation in parallel and serpentine flow-fields, correlating with their degradation in FECO. There- fore, upon the incorporation of the lizard-inspired capillary microchannels onto the conventional serpentine flow-field, the amount of salt is minimized due to efficient water management. These promising results are obtained when capillary micro- channels are incorporated within a flow-field for a geometric MEA area of 2.25 cm2. At such small scale, the distribution of CO2 within the flow-field and the removal of products are inherently more uniform.33 However, as the size of the electrolyzer increases and higher",

This upscaling was performed to test the robustness of the flow-field design under increased spatial constraints. The lizard- inspired serpentine flow-field retains its properties effectively, maintaining a higher CO selectivity and reduced H2 formation at current densities exceeding 200 mA cm2 Figure S10a-c. At 300 mA cm2, the CO selectivity of the lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field is 21 and 16 higher than that of the serpentine flow-field at cell sizes of 2.25 cm2 and 5.06 cm2, respectively. Furthermore, at current densities of 350 mA cm2 and 400 mA cm2, the CO selectivity exceeds that of the traditional serpentine flow-field by 46 and 97, respectively, for a cell size of 5.06 cm2. The lizard-inspired design enhances gas flow management and mass transport dynamics, ensuring efficient removal of salt byproducts and water.36,37 The lizard- inspired serpentine flow-field 5.06 cm2 still has a minimal amount of salt precipitate Figure S11c, while high salt precipitation on the back of the cathode side of the Ag GDE is observed for the parallel flow-field, where the channels are flooded Figure S11a. This improvement is critical for sustaining a high CO2RR efficiency and selectivity in larger devices. Moreover, the lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field achieves these enhancements without incurring additional voltage penalties Figure S10d. This characteristic is partic- ularly advantageous, as it allows for improved performance and selectivity without compromising the overall energy efficiency of the system. In summary, this study highlights the significant impact of a nature-inspired flow-field design on the activity and stability of the CO2RR in zero-gap electrolyzers, building on its proven success in PEMFCs.

The comparative analysis of parallel, serpentine, and lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field based CO2 electrolyzers reveals that while all designs exhibit comparable performance at lower current densities, significant differences arise at higher current densities. Specifically, at 200 mA cm2, the lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field achieves a maximum partial current density for CO of 165.5 mA cm2, outperforming both the parallel and serpentine flow-fields. This indicates that the lizard-inspired design is more effective in overcoming mass transport limitations and sustaining the CO selectivity under high current densities. Furthermore, the lizard-inspired serpentine flow-field shows superior stability, maintaining a stable cell voltage and a CO selectivity of approximately 81.3 over 24 h at 200 mA cm2. In contrast, the conventional serpentine flow-field experiences a decrease in CO selectivity, although it is less severe than the parallel flow-field, which suffers a sharp decline in CO selectivity to 6.4 after just 10 h. These variations are largely attributed to the effective management of water and reduced salt precipitation afforded by the lizard- inspired design. Micro-CT analysis confirms that the lizard- inspired serpentine flow-field has minimal salt crystal formation, which prevents the blockage of the active sites of the catalyst and gas transport channels, further underscoring its potential for enhancing CO2RR performance. The observed salt precipitation detailed in the above sections contradicts earlier reports in the literature suggesting that a low concentration of the anolyte combined with an anion exchange membrane-based MEA can avoid salt precipitation.8,45 Even an anolyte containing 0.1 M KHCO3 combined with a Sustainion- based MEA leads to significant salt concentration after short operation of the CO2 electrolyzer. While the field of CO2RR has advanced significantly in catalyst development and optimization of operating conditions, flow field design remains an underrepresented area despite its critical influence on performance and scalability of the CO2 electrolyzer, as evidenced by the limited number of publications on this topic. A recent report investigated the uniform distribution of CO2 across the catalyst layer via a multiserpentine flow field design achieving 12 h of stable operation at 100 mA cm2.46 However, the optimization of gas flow alone within the flow field is insufficient; our study goes beyond the uniformity of the CO2 distribution, directly addressing critical challenges such as water flooding and salt precipitation through a nature- inspired flow field design achieving superior stability with 24 h of operation at 200 mA cm2. Another report investigates the influence of operating parameters, namely anolyte concen- tration, cation species, membrane thickness, and temperature, on cation accumulation and salt formation.47 The combination of optimal parameters results in a 144 h stable operation at 200 mA cm2 with no measurable salt deposition. However, under the same operating conditions as in our study 0.1 M KHCO3, room temperature, 50 μm thick Sustainion membrane, 200 mA cm2, the operation of the device fails after only 100 min. In",

However, under the same operating conditions as in our study 0.1 M KHCO3, room temperature, 50 μm thick Sustainion membrane, 200 mA cm2, the operation of the device fails after only 100 min. In contrast, our work employs a single, practical strategy that effectively prevents water flooding and salt accumulation without relying on complex parameter combinations, resulting in a stable 24 h operation at 200 mA cm2. Thus, none of the other proposed strategies addition of solvents to the cathode to dissolve and remove precipitates, rinsing of the cell, modified polymer membranes, optimization of the operating conditions have emerged as a single standalone solution to this issue. They are always combined, e.g. cell rinsing and optimal operating conditions, to enable long-term operation, hereby increasing the complexity of the electrolyzer setup and the electrochemical measurements.4,8,47,48 On the contrary, our nature-inspired approach circumvents water flooding and salt precipitation on the GDE via sole modification of the cathodic flow-field. Commercial electrocatalysts and membranes are used for the preparation of GDE, while common operating conditions are utilized. This reduces the cost and complexity of the CO2RR setup allowing the stable operation of the zero-gap electrolyzer. Future research should focus on several key areas to further enhance the CO2RR performance and scalability. Increasing the cell size beyond the tested 5.06 cm2 value will help assess the effectiveness for larger, industrially relevant systems. Addition- ally, optimizing operational parameters such as flow rate, anolyte composition and concentration, temperature, pressure, as well as pulsed electrolysisan area that remains scarcely explored in current literaturecould further improve performance by better preventing the formation of carbonate salt. Moreover, extending stability tests beyond 24 h will be essential to validate long-term durability under practical conditions. Such studies could incorporate periodic electrochemical diagnostics and post-mortem structural analysis to monitor degradation phenomena over time. Furthermore, integrating computational fluid dynamics CFD simulations to elucidate the impact of flow field design on CO2 transport and saltwater blockages could bridge gaps in mechanistic understanding and guide the rational design of the CO2RR systems.

Pt1Bi1 DONS exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic performance for glycerol electrooxidation, achieving an excellent catalytic activity current of 0.82 A mgPt 1 at 0.67 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode RHE and an exceptional selectivity of 96.6 for C3 products, particularly glyceric acid. The superior performance stems from two key factors: 1 electron transfer from Bi2O3 to Pt creates electron-rich Pt sites that suppress CC bond cleavage and 2 Bi2O3 facilitates favorable glycerol adsorp- tion conﬁgurations through multiple hydroxyl group interactions. Mechanistic studies using operando spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that the synergistic effect between Pt and Bi2O3 promotes rapid charge transfer and stable intermediate formation. Moreover, PtBi DONS showed excellent versatility in oxidizing other polyols compared with monoalcohols. 2025 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. and Science China Press.

Introduction Glycerol emerges as a notable byproduct in the biodiesel pro- duction process, accounting for 10 of total output by weight 13. As biodiesel offers a sustainable alternative to conventional fossil fuels owing to its renewable, nontoxic, and biodegradable nature, the resultant excess supply of glycerol has outstripped the current market demand, consequently affecting its economic viability 46. This scenario has driven considerable interest in transforming glycerol into higher-value chemicals 7. Glycerol oxidation yields a spectrum of products 8 from those maintaining the original C3 carbon backbone to smaller C2 and C1 structures derived from one and two CC bond cleavages 9. Among various glycerol derivatives, C3 products, such as glyceraldehyde GLAD, dihydroxyacetone DHA, and glyceric acid GLA, have high eco- nomic value 10. In particular, GLA has garnered attention owing to its application in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic indus- tries and its potential as a precursor for biodegradable polymers and other ﬁne chemicals 1113. Therefore, utilizing excess and low-cost glycerol to obtain higher-value products through electro- chemical transformation 14 stands out as an",

Xiao et al., Adsorption conﬁguration control on Pt-Bi2O3 for the oriented conversion of glycerol to glyceric acid via terminal hydroxyl oxidation, Science Bulletin, https:doi.org10.1016j.scib.2025.05.032 Platinum Pt is regarded as one of the most efﬁcacious electro- catalysts for glycerol oxidation reaction GOR owing to its advan- tageous electronic structure, particularly its low d-band center 1517. However, conventional Pt electrocatalysts exhibit inher- ent limitations substantially restricting their practical applications. First, the propensity for CC bond cleavage on Pt surfaces can lead to the formation of considerable amounts of C1 products, such as formic acid FA and carbon dioxide CO2; however, this occurs alongside the production of substantial C2 and C3 products, which challenges the selective formation of valuable C3 products 15,17 19. Second, the applied oxidation potential and the extended elec- trolysis time unavoidably result in the formation of Pt oxides 4,20, which impede the adsorption of hydroxyls and glycerol and consequently decrease the catalytic activity. In addition, the presence of carbonaceous residues, such as carbon monoxide CO, represents a notable challenge to the catalytic performance as they occupy sites and block channels required for hydroxyl spe- cies interactions 4. CO accumulation generally causes the poison- ing effect, which in turn reduces the catalytic performance and selectivity of the C3 products. It is, therefore, essential to develop innovative approaches to enhance the adsorption and activation of hydroxyl species and organic molecules on Pt-based electrocata- lysts 21. Thus, improving these interactions is crucial for boosting the efﬁciency and selectivity of Pt-based electrocatalysts in GOR. H.-Y. Yang et al. Science Bulletin xxx xxxx xxx The co-adsorption of organic substrates and hydroxyl species is pivotal in achieving selective production of target chemicals 22. Tailoring the adsorption capacity for hydroxyl species, along with optimizing glycerol adsorption conﬁgurations, enhances GOR activity and improves selectivity for C3 products in alkaline media 21. An increased concentration of hydroxyl species results in increased catalytic activity, which can be attributed to the high coverage and diffusion of hydroxyl species 23. In general, hydro- xyl species are more conducive to promoting the conversion of intermediates to carboxylates, given that the greater the number of hydroxyl and oxygen species that are adsorbed, the greater the barrier to the CC bond cleavage 2426. While bismuth Bi and its oxides promote oxygenated species availability on Pt elec- trocatalysts 27,28 and dopants such as Bi 29,30, ruthenium",

While bismuth Bi and its oxides promote oxygenated species availability on Pt elec- trocatalysts 27,28 and dopants such as Bi 29,30, ruthenium Ru 31, and antimony Te 32 show high DHA selectivity, strategi- cally modulating reaction pathways for GLA production remains a major challenge. In particular, the mechanistic role of Bi in direct- ing GOR pathway selectivity and the potential for synergistic effects through rational catalyst design await comprehensive investigation. Herein, Pt nanocrystals Pt NC decorated on bismuth oxide Bi2O3 nanosheets PtBi DONS were synthesized using the gal- vanic replacement reaction. The ultrathin two-dimensional 2D structure of Pt1Bi1 DONS offered a high surface area and efﬁcient mass transfer pathways. The electrochemical analyses revealed that Pt1Bi1 DONS exhibited larger peak oxidation currents and more negative onset potentials 0.36 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode RHE for GOR than commercial Pt nanocrystals cPt NC. Product assays indicated that Pt1Bi1 DONS achieved high selectivity for the conversion of glycerol to C3 high-value chemi- cals, particularly GLA, comprising 88.3 of the C3 products. Nota- bly, the distinct electronic property of Pt1Bi1 DONS improved the selectivity for C3 products, in which the electron-rich Pt helped in controlling the oxidation degree of the CC bond. Furthermore, the presence of Bi2O3 facilitated the adsorption of OHads groups in the polyols to form a more stable adsorption conformation and promoted the rapid transfer of electrons. 2.

Further details regarding the methods can be found in the Sup- plementary material. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Structural and compositional characterizations of Pt1Bi1 DONS The galvanic replacement reaction between Bi nanosheets Bi NS and K2PtCl4 was employed to synthesize Pt1Bi1 DONS using the difference in standard electrode potentials between Bi E Bi3Bi 0.308 V and K2PtCl4 E PtCl4 2Pt 0.755 V Fig. 1a. In this galvanic replacement reaction process, the presyn- thesized Bi NS synchronously serve as a reducing agent and a structural template. The spontaneous redox reaction results in a reduction of PtCl4 2and the simultaneous oxidation of Bi, thereby leading to the formation of a distinctive nanosheet structure of Pt1- Bi1 DONS. The morphological characteristics of Pt1Bi1 DONS were elucidated through a comprehensive suite of microscopic and spec- troscopic techniques. Transmission electron microscopy TEM analysis Figs. 1b and Fig. S1 online and high-angle annular dark-ﬁeld electron microscopy HAADF-STEM Fig. 1c reveal that Pt1Bi1 DONS preserves the intrinsic skeletal structure of Bi NS. Atomic force microscopy AFM measurement Fig. 1d reveals an average thickness of 3.5 nm for Pt1Bi1 DONS, corroborating the ultrathin nature of the nanosheets as evidenced by TEM analysis. High-resolution TEM HRTEM analysis of Pt1Bi1 DONS reveals the distinct lattice fringes with d-spacings of 0.196 and 0.268 nm Fig. 1e, which are associated with the Pt 200 and a-Bi2O3 200 crystallographic planes, respectively. High-angle annular dark-ﬁeld electron microscopy HAADF-STEM energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy EDX mapping Fig. 1f demonstrates the homogeneous dispersion of Pt NC throughout Bi2O3 nanosheets Bi2O3 NS. Quantitative compositional analysis, performed using EDX and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy ICP-OES, illustrates the PtBi atomic ratio in Pt1Bi1 DONS to be 44.79:55.21 Fig. S2a online and 43.8:55.2 Fig. S2b online. To elucidate the crystallographic structure and phase composi- tion of the synthesized Pt1Bi1 DONS, X-ray diffraction XRD anal- ysis was conducted. The resulting diffractogram Fig. 2a reveals a complex pattern indicative of a multiphase system. Distinct diffraction peaks are observed at 39.7, 46.2, 67.5, and 81.3, which can be unambiguously indexed to the 111, 200, 220, and 311 lattice planes of face-centered cubic fcc Pt, respec- tively. These reﬂections align with the standard pattern of metallic Pt JCPDS card No. 04-0802, indicating the successful reduction of K2PtCl4.

Notably, these Bi2O3 reﬂections exhibit a slight downshift in Pt1Bi1 DONS, indicating the successful decoration of Pt NC on the surface of Bi2O3 NS. Meanwhile, the XRD result of Bi NS Fig. S3 online perfectly matches the standard JCPDS No. 44-1246 for pure Bi, proving that the Bi2O3 in Pt1Bi1 DONS is primarily produced through the galvanic replacement reaction. Such a structural arrangement suggests a decorated nanosheet morphology, where Pt NC are dispersed on the Bi2O3 NS surface, maintaining the integrity of the underlying oxide structure. H.-Y.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS analysis was performed to investigate the chemical states and electronic structure of the constituent elements in Pt1Bi1 DONS Fig. 2b. The deconvolution of the Pt 4f spectrum Fig. 2c reveals a characteristic doublet cor- responding to the Pt 4f72 and Pt 4f52 core levels, with binding energies of 70.62 and 73.94 eV, respectively. These values repre- sent a notable downward shift of 0.48 eV compared to that of bulk metallic Pt typically 71.1 eV for Pt 4f72, which indicates the elec- tron enrichment of Pt NC 34. Furthermore, XPS analysis reveals that the majority of Pt exists in its metallic state Pt0, as evidenced by the relatively smaller peak areas corresponding to Pt2 in com- parison to those observed for cPt NC. The signiﬁcant reduction in the Pt2 peak area for Pt1Bi1 DONS catalysts highlights the role of the Bi2O3 support in stabilizing Pt and suppressing surface oxida- tion Fig. S4 online. The Bi 4f spectrum Fig. 2d exhibits the peaks at binding energies of 158.73 eV Bi 4f72 and 164.04 eV Bi 4f52 with a slight positive shift of 0.13 eV, further demonstrating the reduced electron density of Bi3 in Bi2O3 35. The observed binding energy downshift in the Pt 4f spectrum, coupled with the positive shift of Bi 4f binding energies, indicates that the electron transfer between Pt and Bi2O3, where Pt acts as an electron acceptor from Bi2O3 NS.

The R-space Fourier-transform extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure FT-EXAFS, Fig. 2f spectrum of Pt in Pt1Bi1 DONS provides further insights, showing a dominant peak at 2.42 Å corresponding to the PtPt bond, further demonstrating that Pt in Pt1Bi1 DONS is in the metallic Pt0 form. The PtPt bond strength in Pt1Bi1 DONS is signiﬁcantly weakened compared to that in Pt foil, indicating that Pt atoms are highly dispersed on the Bi2O3 nanosheets 16,39. Unlike PtO2, no notable PtO bond is observed in the Pt1Bi1 DONS. Furthermore, the wavelet transforms WT- EXAFS, Figs. 2gi of Pt foils, Pt1Bi1 DONS, and PtO2 elucidate the coordination environments of Pt in Pt1Bi1 DONS. WT-EXAFS spec- tra at the Pt L3-edge for Pt1Bi1 DONS indicate a maximum intensity at 2.67 Å, 9.05 Å1, attributed to the electron dispersion and enrichment 40,41, distinct from those of Pt foil PtPt: 2.65 Å, 9.5 Å1 and PtO2 PtO: 1.65 Å, 7.25 Å1. This further conﬁrms the unique electronic structure of Pt within Pt1Bi1 DONS 42.

Activity and selectivity of Pt1Bi1 DONS for GOR The electrocatalytic activity of the Pt-doped Bi2O3 nanosheets for GOR was systematically evaluated under alkaline solution using a three-electrode system. A comprehensive investigation of the electrocatalytic performance was conducted by systematically varying the glycerol concentration from 50 mmol L1 to 1.0 mol L1 to understand its impact on the catalytic behavior. Linear sweep voltammetry LSV results Fig. 3a reveal a systematic negative shift in the onset potential with increasing glycerol concentration. Notably, the relationship between glycerol concentration and cur- rent density followed a nonmonotonic trend. As the concentration increased from 50 mmol L1 to 0.5 mol L1, a signiﬁcant enhance- ment in current density is observed, and the onset potential nega- tively shifts from 0.46 to 0.35 V vs. RHE. However, a further increase to 1.0 mol L1 results in a negligible increase in perfor- mance. Thus, the optimal current is achieved",

However, a further increase to 1.0 mol L1 results in a negligible increase in perfor- mance. Thus, the optimal current is achieved at 0.5 mol L1 glyc- erol, suggesting a balance between reactant availability and mass transport efﬁciency. Consequently, 0.5 mol L1 glycerol is selected for subsequent electrochemical characterizations. Notably, the control experiments are conducted in the absence of glycerol, where Pt1Bi1 DONS exhibit negligible current response, conﬁrming the speciﬁcity of Pt1Bi1 DONS for catalyzing glycerol oxidation. 4 To determine the optimal PtBi ratio, LSV curves Fig. 3b were obtained for Pt1Bi1 DONS, cPt NC, and Pt1Bi3 DONS Figs. S7 and S8 online. The characterization results Figs. S9S11 online of Pt1Bi3 DONS conﬁrm that the morphology is similar to Pt1Bi1 DONS and the PtBi ratio is 1:3, respectively. When operating at a current of 200 mA mgcat 1, Pt1Bi1 DONS achieve a potential of 0.53 V vs. RHE, demonstrating superior electrocatalytic performance com- pared to both Pt1Bi3 DONS 0.59 V vs. RHE and cPt NC 0.65 V vs. RHE. Cyclic voltammetry CV studies Fig. 3c corroborate the LSV ﬁndings. The GOR peak currents follow the order of Pt1Bi1 DONS Pt1Bi3 DONS cPt NC. Exhibiting a GOR mass activity of 3.98 A mgPt 1 at peak potential, Pt1Bi1 DONS surpasses cPt NC by 3.8-fold and Pt1Bi3 DONS by 2.4-fold, underscoring the optimal Pt:Bi ratio to be 1:1 to maximize catalytic activity. In addition, the distinctively larger inverse peak observed for Pt1Bi1 DONS reﬂects the synergistic interactions between Pt and Bi2O3 that fos- ter extensive oxide formation and reduction cycles, ultimately enhancing the regeneration of active sites and resulting in superior catalytic performance. To elucidate the kinetic aspects of the cat- alytic process, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy EIS tests were employed. Nyquist plots Fig. 3d reveal that Pt1Bi1 DONS exhibit the smallest charge transfer resistance among Pt1Bi3 DONS and cPt NC. The enhanced electron transfer kinetics at the electrode-electrolyte interface correlate well with the enhanced catalytic activity observed in LSV and CV measurements. H.-Y. Yang et al.

The oxidation products were characterized both qualitatively and quantitatively using the complementary analytic techniques 1H NMR spectra Fig. S12 online and HPLC Figs. S13S16 and Table S1 online across different electrocatalysts. Pt1Bi1 DONS demonstrates superior selectivity of 92.2 for the C3 products at a potential of 0.87 V vs. RHE, suggesting that the optimal Pt:Bi ratio in Pt1Bi1 DONS promotes the preservation of the carbon skeleton during GOR Fig. 3e. By contrast, Pt1Bi3 DONS and cPt NC exhibit signiﬁcantly lower selectivities of 91.8 and 76.8 for the C3 prod- ucts, respectively, yielding a more diverse array of oxidation prod- ucts, such as the C1 product FA and C2 products OA and HAc. The enhanced C3 selectivity is attributed to the optimal electronic structure resulting from the interaction between Pt and Bi2O3 in Pt1Bi1 DONS. Given the notable inﬂuence of applied potential on GOR, we conducted characterization of the oxidation products gen- erated by Pt1Bi1 DONS at varied potentials Fig. 3f. At lower poten- tials, the C3 products predominate, indicating preferential oxidation of primary alcohol groups without CC bond cleavage 43. As the potential increases, the selectivity for C3 products grad- ually decreases from 96.6 to 92.2, indicating the onset of CC bond cleavage. The observed decline in C3 selectivity with increas- ing potential can be explained by the enhanced CC bond scission, which occurs as the electrocatalyst surface adopts a higher oxida- tion state 44. The timed current test amperometry i-t curves, AC Fig. S17 online indicates that the Pt1Bi1 DONS exhibit good stabil- ity, which is better than cPt NC. The postreaction characterization data of SEM Fig. S18 online, TEM Fig. S19 online, and XPS Fig. S20 online conﬁrm that the Pt1Bi1 DONS retain their original morphological features and chemical states, demonstrating excel- lent structural and chemical stability under electrochemical condi- tions during the GOR. 5 3.3. The role of Bi2O3 in Pt1Bi1 DONS of GOR To elucidate the role of Bi2O3 in Pt1Bi1 DONS, we compared the activity and selectivity of Pt1Bi1 DONS, PtBi nanosheets PtBi NS, Bi2O3 nanosheets Bi2O3 NS Figs. S21 and S22 online, and Bi nanosheets Bi NS during GOR. The characterization data of PtBi NS Figs.

The CV result Fig. 4a shows the signiﬁcantly higher peak mass activity of Pt1Bi1 DONS 3.98 A mgPt 1 than PtBi NS 1.93 A mgPt 1, with an earlier onset potential indicative of superior efﬁciency in initiating the GOR. From the LSV curves Fig. 4b, Pt1Bi1 DONS distinctly outper- form all other catalysts, underscoring the synergistic effect between Pt and Bi2O3, which is absent in both PtBi NS and Bi2O3 NS.

Furthermore, Pt1Bi1 DONS exhibit a lower resistance during GOR than PtBi NS Fig. 4c, reﬂecting enhanced charge transfer kinetics facilitated by the unique Pt-Bi2O3 interface. The product distribution from GOR catalyzed by PtBi NS Fig. 4d was also determined using HPLC Figs. S26 and S27 and Table S2 online, revealing distinct differences in selectivity. For Pt1Bi1 DONS, GLA was the predominant product. By contrast, PtBi NS generated a broader range of products, including C1 to C3, with a considerable contribution of DHA, a C3 product notably absent in Pt1Bi1 DONS catalytic reaction. These comparisons highlight the critical role of the Bi2O3 in Pt1Bi1 DONS, which not only ﬁne-tunes the electronic structure of Pt to facilitate C3-selective production but also enhances the speciﬁed production of GLA.

To further verify the function of Bi2O3, the CV measurement was conducted on Bi2O3 NS Fig. S28 online. The results exhibit a char- acteristic oxidation peak at 0.56 V vs. RHE in N2-saturated 1 mol L1 KOH solution during the CV scan blue curve. However, on intro- ducing 0.5 mol L1 glycerol, both the oxidation peak and reduction peaks were completely suppressed green curve, indicating that the OHads species from glycerol preferentially adsorb on the Bi2O3 surface, subsequently blocking the Bi2O3 adsorption sites. Supported by the LSV data Fig. 4b showing negligible current for Bi2O3 NS in the presence of glycerol, it is evident that Bi2O3 NS lack intrinsic GOR capability. Thus, the primary role of Bi2O3 NS is to provide adsorption sites for glycerol, thereby enhancing oxidation through synergistic interactions with Pt. The volcano plot Fig. 4e derived from density functional theory DFT calcula- tions Fig. S29 online illustrates the correlation between the bind- ing energy of glycerol OH species and the GLA production rate for various catalytic surfaces, including Pt1Bi1 DONS, PtBi NS, and Pt.

Two distinct adsorption conﬁgurations are considered namely the lying-down conﬁguration 2OH and the standing conﬁgura- tion 1OH. Pt1Bi1 DONS with the lying conﬁguration Pt1Bi1- 2OH reside at the volcanos peak, signifying the highest catalytic activity and optimal binding energy. This conﬁguration facilitates the formation of GLA due to the simultaneous interaction of two hydroxyl groups with the catalyst surface. Conversely, the standing conﬁguration calculated for Pt1Bi1 DONS and PtBi NS displays a lower activity as it binds too weakly or too strongly. Interestingly, glycerol demonstrates a strong preference for the lying conﬁgura- tion on Pt1Bi1 DONS, whereas the standing conﬁguration is favored on PtBi NS. The preferential adsorption conﬁguration on Pt1Bi1 DONS enhances the selective production of GLA, emphasizing the critical role of Bi2O3 in modulating the Pt binding environment and steering glycerol oxidation toward GLA rather than DHA. 6 Considering the function of Bi2O3 for tuning the adsorption of OHads, we extend the testing of Pt1Bi1 DONS against other multicar- bon alcohols, namely ethylene glycol EG, mannitol, n-propanol, methanol, and ethanol. LSV curves Fig. 4f compare the perfor- mances of Pt1Bi1 DONS in the oxidation of polyols and monoalco- hols. Notably, Pt1Bi1 DONS exhibit considerably higher currents and more negative onset potentials for polyols EG and mannitol than monoalcohols n-propanol, methanol, and ethanol. The CV tests Fig. S30 online further demonstrate the consistent role of Bi2O3 NS across all tested polyols, with oxidation and reduction peaks completely suppressed due to the strong adsorption of poly- ols on Bi2O3 NS, whereas these peaks remain observable with monoalcohols. This adsorption behavior of the Bi2O3 NS confers versatility upon the Pt1Bi1 DONS by providing effective sites for diverse polyols, which stabilize reaction intermediates and enhance catalytic activity. Such adaptability underscores the cru- cial Pt and Bi2O3 synergy, extending the notable electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst from glycerol oxidation to a wider spectrum of polyols. H.-Y. Yang et al. Science Bulletin xxx xxxx xxx 3.4. The reaction mechanism of GOR To further elucidate the enhanced catalytic activity over Pt1Bi1 DONS, operando EIS was employed to study the GOR process, pro- viding insights into the electrode and electrolyte interface proper- ties. The Bode plots for Pt1Bi1 DONS Fig. 5a reveal a narrow single peak across the frequency spectrum, indicative of a more uniform and accelerated charge transfer process, which suggests enhanced kinetics for surface OHads adsorption and subsequent interaction with glycerol molecules 45. Compared to Pt1Bi3 DONS and cPt NC, Pt1Bi1 DONS exhibit lower phase angles, which in EIS typically denotes less resistive behavior 22. In this context, it implies faster reaction kinetics and facilitated charge transfer, corroborating the earlier EIS observations Fig. 3d.

By contrast, cPt NC Fig. 5b dis- play a bimodal response with distinct low and high-frequency peaks, while Pt1Bi1 DONS demonstrate a simpliﬁed impedance pro- ﬁle 46. The 1:1 ratio of Pt:Bi optimizes the surface for OHads adsorption and its reaction with glycerol, potentially streamlining the reaction mechanism. While Pt1Bi3 DONS Fig. S31 online also show enhancements compared to cPt NC, the comparatively lower phase angles and the broader peak of Pt1Bi1 DONS indicate that the 1:1 ratio achieves an optimal balance for OHads adsorption and utilization in the GOR. Moreover, Pt1Bi3 DONS exhibit a more pronounced peak in the midfrequency range, suggesting increased capacitive behavior 47. The pronounced peak can be attributed to higher Bi content, leading to stronger adsorption of reaction intermediates or a more developed electrical double layer. However, the higher phase angles observed in Pt1Bi3 DONS relative to Pt1Bi1 DONS imply slower charge transfer kinetics, indicating that while increasing Bi content enhances OHads adsorption, it may simulta- neously inhibit the subsequent reaction steps through stronger intermediate binding. By contrast, the Bode plots of PtBi NS Fig. S32 online display an even broader peak than that of Pt1Bi1 DONS, suggesting multiple overlapping kinetic processes. The broader peak indicates less efﬁcient charge transfer dynamics and increased intermediate accumulation on the catalyst surface, likely arising from the PtBi NS lack of Bi2O3, which is optimized for efﬁcient OHads modulation in Pt1Bi1 DONS.

During GOR, the response of Pt1Bi1 DONS exhibits narrower peaks that shifted toward higher frequencies, indicating a relatively uniform process with a fast charge transfer rate. By contrast, the oxidation of n-propanol results in broader peaks, more prominently centered around lower frequencies, sug- gesting a more complex process with signiﬁcant resistance at the molecular adsorption site.

Conversely, n-propanol displays varied adsorption conﬁgurations, resulting in the formation of adsorbed reactants and intermediates with diverse binding strengths. The presence of Bi2O3 facilitates a stable conformation for polyols such as glyc- erol, wherein multiple hydroxyl groups are adsorbed on Pt1Bi1 DONS. This not only simpliﬁes the reaction pathway but also enhances hydroxyl activation of the polyols, reducing reliance on hydroxyl ions in solution, which elucidates why polyols generally outperform monoalcohols in the LSV curves Fig. 4f. H.-Y. Yang et al. Science Bulletin xxx xxxx xxx To investigate the GOR kinetics at Pt1Bi1 DONS, electrochemical in situ Raman spectroscopy was applied Fig. 5d, revealing the characteristic vibrational modes of glycerol and its oxidation inter- mediates. The spectral analysis shows intensive peaks in the 800 1000 cm1 region, which are attributed to the sCH2 vibrations of the glycerol 48. The distinct bands around 1050 and 1109 cm1 are assigned to the ʋsCOH modes associated with the terminal and intermediate carbon atoms of glycerol, respectively 49. Nota- bly, the vibrational peaks at 10881130 cm1 diminish with increasing potential, indicating the consumption of the OH groups on intermediate carbon atoms. By contrast, the intensity of the peaks at 10201080 cm1 remains relatively constant, suggesting that the OH groups on the terminal carbon atoms are not signiﬁ- cantly consumed. The peaks below 400 cm1, attributed to OHads adsorbed on Bi, suggest a favorable environment for OHads adsorp- tion, with their intensities slightly decreasing as the potential increases. This behavior implies that the OH groups adsorbed dur- ing polyol oxidation likely originate from the structure of glycerol rather than external sources. In addition, the CC vibrational mode at 518 cm1 exhibits minor changes, indicating variations in the adsorption geometries of glycerol and its intermediates. Notably, the PtC stretching peak at 438 cm1 remains relatively constant across the potential range, indicating the preservation of CC bonds 50. The stability is likely due to the electron-rich Pt envi- ronment enhanced by Bi2O3, which effectively reduces CC bond cleavage and thus improves the C3 selectivity of Pt1Bi1 DONS. A slight increase in the CO peak intensity 2110 cm1 is observed at higher potentials 51, consistent with the minor decrease in C3 product selectivity at elevated potentials Fig. 3f. The reaction intermediates were monitored using in situ Fourier-transform infrared in-situ FTIR spectroscopy Fig. 5e. The spectral analysis reveals characteristic peaks at 1317 and 1400 cm1, attributed to the symmetric carboxylate group stretch- ing modes, alongside a peak at 1580 cm1, which is assigned to the asymmetric carboxylate stretching 52. Additionally, a distinct vibrational feature at 1745 cm1 is attributed to the CO stretching of carboxylic acids or aldehydes 5355. As the applied potential increases, the intensities of these peaks increase, signifying the for- mation of GLA as the predominant product over the tested poten- tial range.",

As the applied potential increases, the intensities of these peaks increase, signifying the for- mation of GLA as the predominant product over the tested poten- tial range. By contrast, the peaks at 1032 and 1145 cm1 are associated with the CO stretching vibrations 25. Notably, the persistence of CO peaks at elevated potential indicates partial oxi- dation of glycerol 56, suggesting a high likelihood of preserving the C3 structure. The electron-rich nature of Pt in Pt1Bi1 facilitates controlled partial oxidation, preventing extensive CC bond cleav- age and promoting selective production. Therefore, the reaction pathway for glycerol oxidation on Pt1Bi1 DONS, as shown in Fig. 5f, is a stepwise oxidation process culmi- nating in the formation of tartronic acid. First, glycerol undergoes successive oxidation steps, each involving the loss of two electrons and protons coupled with the addition of hydroxyl ions. This pro- gression leads to the formation of glyceraldehyde, which subse- quently oxidizes to GLA, thereby maintaining the original C3 carbon skeleton. It is noteworthy that the selectivity for C3 prod- ucts can be attributed to the unique electronic properties of Pt1Bi1 DONS, where the electron-rich Pt facilitates controlled oxidation. Meanwhile, the presence of Bi2O3 for the adsorption of the OH groups in polyols, which changes the adsorption conﬁguration, results in the selective production of GLA. 8 4. Conclusion Herein, Pt1Bi1 DONS were developed to achieve a highly selec- tive yield of C3 value-added products during GOR. Pt1Bi1 DONS demonstrate notable performance, delivering a current of 0.82 A mg1 at 0.67 V vs. RHE and achieving an impressive GLA selectivity of 88.3 and an overall C3 selectivity of 96.6 across a broad potential range. Uniquely, Pt1Bi1 DONS facilitate a pathway exclusively converting glycerol to GLA, as opposed to Pt1Bi3 DONS and cPt NC, where additional pathways are active. Both experimen- tal and theoretical analyses reveal that the electron-rich nature of Pt diminishes its propensity to cleave CC bonds, thus curtailing the formation of C2C1 products. In addition, the adsorption conﬁg- uration of glycerol is critical in determining the product proﬁle, suggesting that the adsorption conﬁguration optimized by Bi2O3 NS can further modulate reaction pathways and thus favor GLA production. This study introduces high-performance Pt1Bi1 DONS for converting glycerol into C3 products and elucidates the mecha- nisms behind their enhanced activity, proposing that the inﬂuence of Bi2O3 on the polyol adsorption conﬁguration can be pivotal in directing reaction pathways.

However, the highly dynamic gaselectrolyte catalyst interface, where ions and reactant molecules exchange in a disorderly manner, restricts the electrocatalytic selectivity and stability. Herein, we immobilize quaternary ammonium cations onto covalent organic frameworks COFs to tailor the interface environment for boosting the electrosynthesis of ethylene. We find that the hydrophobic and microporous structures of the COFs enable fast CO2 transport and rational H2O distribution, while the migration of cations is elegantly tailored through the Donnan effect. As a result, the COF-based electrode delivers a Faradaic efficiency of 46.8 and a high partial current density of 374.2 mA cm2 for ethylene. A developed COF-based practical zero-gap membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer is further demonstrated with stable ethylene production over 89.6 h. In situ spectra and density functional theoretical calculations unveil that the cationic COFs further enhance the local electric field strength, resulting in stronger CO adsorption and a boosted CO dimerization rate. Our study provides a new avenue to enhance multicarbon production via tuning the cathode local mass and charge transfer. INTRODUCTION Electroreduction of CO2 CO2RR to multicarbon products has been regarded as a promising method for CO2 resource utilization. Copper has been proven to be the most active catalyst for multicarbon production; however, it encounters undesirable selectivity and stability.1,2 Many strategies, such as adjusting the electronic structures, morphologies, or defects of copper catalysts, have been widely studied.36 And yet CO2RR takes place at the gaselectrolytecatalyst triple-phase interface, where CO2, H2O and ions usually exchange in a disorderly manner, limiting catalytic efficiency.79 Specifically, gas and water management critically influence the adsorption and diffusion of reactants and related intermediates.10,11 Notably, the overaccumulation of aqueous cations within the cathodes has been proven to lead to salt precipitation, block active sites, and lower energy and carbon efficiencies.7,12,13 Therefore, engineering the local microenvironment to reduce the dynamic degree of the interface is urgently needed. Organic modifiers, including amines,14,15 thiols,16 N- heterocyclic carbenes,17,18 bipyridyl molecules,19,20 and fluo- rocarbons,21 have demonstrated efficacy in tailoring the interface microenvironment to enhance CO2RR selectivity and activity. However, up to now, current mechanistic studies predominantly focus on intermediate adsorption energetics on electrode surfaces in molecular-enhanced CO2RR. Fundamen- tal studies of the triple-phase interface structure, the transport behaviors of chemical species CO2, H2O and ions near the catalysts, and the charge transfer kinetics remain lacking, requiring deeper experimental and theoretical elucidation. Herein, we immobilized quaternary ammonium cations onto hydrophobic covalent organic frameworks COFs to tailor the interface microenvironment for achieving the selective and stable electrosynthesis of ethylene from CO2 Scheme 1. Our results suggest that the COF modification significantly enhances ethylene production at industrial-scale",

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Synthesis and Characterization of Hydrophobic COFs. The hydrophobic COFs were prepared using a solvothermal method as described in our previous work.22 Fluorine-modified monomers were deliberately selected to increase their hydrophobicity. The experimental and simulated XRD patterns reveal that the fluorinated COFs exhibit typical AA rather than AB molecular stacking structures Figures 1a,S1 and S2. Quaternary ammonium cation-modified COFs denoted as Me-COF were further prepared using the impregnation method Figure S3. On the one hand, the strong electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine atoms Figure S4 facilitates the robust adsorption of quaternary ammonium cations, as evidenced by the binding energy shift of F 1s following functionalization with quaternary ammonium cations Figure S5. On the other hand, the nanocavity size of the COFs, approximately 3 nm, allows for the precise confinement of NCH34Br salts, as demonstrated by the N 1s XPS spectra Scheme 1.

And the crystal structure of the COF remains intact after loading with quaternary ammonium cations Figure S7. To further probe the chemical bonding properties, Fourier transform infrared FT-IR spectroscopy was performed Figure S8. The characteristic peak at 1625 cm1 corresponds to the C N stretching vibration, confirming the formation of imine bonds in the fluorinated COFs, which can also be verified by the solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra Figure S9. Additionally, the bands at 949 cm1, 1356 cm1 and 1492 cm1 are attributed to the characteristic -NCH34",

Additionally, the bands at 949 cm1, 1356 cm1 and 1492 cm1 are attributed to the characteristic -NCH34 peaks, further corroborating the successful immobilization of quaternary ammonium cations. To investigate the effect of the chemical environment during the CO2 reduction reaction CO2RR induced by cationic COFs, we further evaluated the CO2 adsorption capacity and hydrophobicity. As shown in Figure 1c, Me-COF demonstrates a significantly higher CO2 adsorption capacity than bare COF, primarily due to the strong affinity of quaternary ammonium cations for CO2 molecules,23 which would be beneficial for CO2 mass transport. Additionally, the nanocavities of the COFs also contribute to CO2 enrichment. We further conducted dynamic CO2 bubble transport experiments to gain quantitative validation for the enhanced CO2 mass transport24 Figure S10. Clearly, the CO2 bubble quickly disappeared after touching the CuMe-COF electrode, while residual bubbles persisted for several seconds on both Cu COF and bare Cu electrodes. These observations establish a CO2 transport efficiency gradient of cationic COFs pristine COFs Cu. Compared to the copper electrode, the CuCOF and Cu Me-COF electrodes exhibit improved hydrophobicity Figures S11 and S12, which helps prevent cathode flooding during the CO2RR. Notably, the bare COF is slightly more hydrophobic than the quaternary ammonium-functionalized COF, likely due to the inherent hydrophilicity of quaternary ammonium cations. K adsorption tests on catalysts were further conducted to investigate the ion transport properties Figures S13 and 1d. The results reveal that the local adsorbed K concentration on the CuMe-COF is much lower than those on the CuMOF and Cu electrodes. The incorporated quaternary ammonium cations could effectively repel K diffusion via the Donnan effect, potentially alleviating carbonate precipitation. Overall, the hydrophobic cationic COFs provide a tailored CO2, H2O and K transport pathway, efficiently modulating the microenvironment for the CO2RR. Electrochemical Performance Measurements. We evaluated the CO2 reduction reaction CO2RR performance of COF-modified nanocopper electrodes Figure S14 under alkaline conditions 1 M KOH. First, we studied the effects of the alkyl chain length of quaternary ammonium salts on the CO2RR performance Figure S15. Obviously, the FE of C2H4 decreases with an increased alkyl chain length, which may be due to the increased hydrophobicity. However, the accom- modation of H2O will simultaneously be suppressed. The best performance appears to result from an optimal gaselectrolyte distribution. Subsequently, the mass ratio of copper to cationic COFs was systematically optimized Figure S16. Data in Figure S17 reveal that the CuMe-COF electrode exhibits a lower overpotential compared to CuCOF and Cu electrodes, indicating higher CO2RR kinetics. As further shown in Figure 2a, the Faradaic efficiency FE of ethylene on the CuMe-COF and CuCOF electrodes significantly increases across the full current density range 200800 mA cm2, with the maximum partial current density for C2H4 reaching 374.2 mA cm2 Figure 2b.

Notably, the CuMe-COF electrode also exhibits remarkable ethylene production with diluted CO2 feed 40 vol , using Ar for dilution Figure 2c, highlighting the enhanced mass transfer of CO2 within cationic COF-modified cathodes. High selectivity of C2 products could still be achieved on the CuMe-COF electrode under lower CO2 flow rates Figure S19. The CO2RR performances in acidic electrolyte pH 2 were further investigated Figure S20. Although the CO2 electro- catalytic efficiencies are slightly decreased compared to those under alkaline environments, the FE of C2 products on the Me-COF-based electrode is still higher, which is due to the positive charge and hydrophobic nature of the cationic COFs. Besides, the COFs were also found to exhibit a promoting effect for CO electroreduction Figure S21, highlighting the universal application of COFs in reaction environment tailoring. To isolate the potential contribution of COFs to activity, the CO2RR performances of bare COF and Me-COF were further assessed in a 1 M KOH electrolyte Figure S22. The hydrogen evolution reaction was found to dominate, confirming that the COFs act primarily as promoter additives for microenvironment tailoring. Additionally, the electro- chemical surface area ECSA of the samples shows no significant change according to the electric double-layer capacitance Cdl measurements Figure S23, supporting the intrinsic promoting role of the hydrophobic cationic COFs. We further investigated the CO2RR performance in practical alkaline zero-gap MEA devices Figure S24. It is important to note that the chemical microenvironment at the cathode differs between flow cells and MEA electrolyzers.25 For instance, the transport of ions, water, and CO2 may vary significantly, thereby affecting product selectivity. During CO2 electrolysis, dry CO2 was fed to the cathode without humidification to alleviate possible flooding, while a 10 mM KHCO3 solution was used as the anolyte to prevent salt precipitation within the cathode. As shown in Figure 2d, the FE of C2H4 reaches 46.6 at 500 mA cm2 with a cell voltage of 3.61 V, and the selectivity for CO decreases with an increasing current density. The partial current density for ethylene reaches 253.7 mA cm2 at an operating voltage of 3.68 V, representing one of the best performance metrics observed in MEA electrolyzers. The stability of the MEA device was further evaluated",

The stability of the MEA device was further evaluated at an industrial current density. Interestingly, the C2H4 FE gradually increases during electrolysis, reaching a maximum value of 40.0. This behavior is primarily attributed to the micro- environment change during the CO2 electrolysis. For H2O molecules and K would gradually transport to the cathode due Figure 3.

The final failure of the MEA electrolyzer was found to be largely attributed to the decrease in cathode hydrophobicity Figure S25 and salt precipitation within the cathode and flow fields Figure S26, consistent with previous reports.28,29 In Situ Spectra Studies and Theoretical Calculations. Seeking to elucidate the promoting role of quaternary ammonium functionalized COF, in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy ATR-SEIRAS was performed to monitor the surface species. As shown in Figure 3a,b, several characteristic vibration bands appear in the 18003500 cm1 region during the CO2RR. The vibration band at around 20502060 cm1 can be assigned to the linearly bonded COL species, while no distinct bridge- adsorbed COB is observed. This absence is likely due to the distinct crystal and defective structure of the copper catalyst. Although many researchers have reported that the existence of bridge-adsorbed COB is beneficial for multicarbon forma- tion,20,30,31 this was not observed in our study, indicating that the CC coupling process may proceed via a nontraditional pathway, warranting further investigation. Compared to the pure copper electrode, the vibration band of COL on CuMe- COF electrode shifts to a lower wavenumber, revealing that CuMe-COF exhibits higher affinity toward CO intermediate and thus is more favorable for CO dimerization, which agrees well with the in situ Raman spectra Figure S27. In addition to the increased CO adsorption strength, the CuMe-COF electrode also exhibits a higher Stark tuning rate 14.5 cm1V compared to that of the Cu electrode 11.5 cm1V, as shown in Figure 3c,d. The Stark tuning rate is considered as a key indicator of the local electric field strength.32 This finding implies that the quaternary ammo- nium-functionalized COF creates a stronger local electric field across the electric",

The Stark tuning rate is considered as a key indicator of the local electric field strength.32 This finding implies that the quaternary ammo- nium-functionalized COF creates a stronger local electric field across the electric double layer Figure 3e. A local electric field near the electric double layer can boost CC coupling rate by interacting with COL or other adsorbates with certain dipole moment and polarizability.33,34 It is known that quaternary ammonium cations, confined within the COF cavities, have a larger ionic radius compared to alkali metal cations. As a result, they possess less tightly bound hydration shells, giving rise to a larger charge density and a subsequently much stronger interfacial electric field.35 Additionally, a broad band observed in the range of 3010 3500 cm1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of interfacial water νH2O. Obviously, the intensity of νH2O on the CuMe-COF electrode is significantly lower than that on the Cu electrode, suggesting a relatively lower water content and, consequently, suppressed water flooding at the catalytic interface. To quantify this observation, we calculated the peak area ratio of νCOL to νH2O across different applied potentials. The νCOLνH2O area ratio for the CuMe- COF electrode is noticeably higher than that for the Cu electrode Figure 3f, indicating that Me-COF modification leads to higher CO coverage relative to water at the electrocatalytic interface, which efficiently promotes CC coupling toward C2 products. To further clarify the adsorption behavior of interfacial water, we performed Gaussian fitting on the infrared band of Figure 4. a The optimized structures of Cu 100Me-COF, CO adsorption, and COCO coupling on Cu 100Me-COF surface. b CO adsorption energy and c free energy change of CC coupling process on electrodes.

These peaks were resolved into three different parts: the 4- coordinated hydrogen-bonded water 4-HBH2O, the 2- coordinated hydrogen-bonded water 2-HBH2O, and the K ion-hydrated water KH2O. The results demonstrate that the percentage of the KH2O peak was higher on the Cu electrode than on the CuMe-COF electrode, indicating a decrease in hydrogen bonds, increased H coverage, and correspondingly stronger activity for water dissociation.36 The results fully reflect the hydrophobic nature of the cationic COFs. To determine the actual state of the catalytic sites, XRD patterns and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy HRTEM characterizations were performed. The XRD results reveal that Cu2O component was almost completely reduced to metallic copper after CO2RR Figure S29, while Cu 100 and 111 facets are clearly observed in the HRTEM images Figure S30. To further investigate the exposed surface facet ratio, we examined the electrochemical adsorption of OHon the catalysts i.e., Cu OHCuOHad e in terms of their facet-dependent OHadsorption behavior Figure S31.

The cyclic voltammetry curve shows an OHadsorption peak at 0.34 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode RHE, corresponding to OHadsorption on the Cu 100 surface. No obvious peaks attributed to Cu 110 and 111 adsorption were observed. At this point, the Cu 100 facet is confirmed to be the major exposed structure during CO2 electrolysis. Density functional theoretical DFT calculations were conducted to investigate the role of cationic COFs in the CO2RR mechanism. Based on the characterizations of the cathode after CO2RR, the Cu 100 facet was first selected as the model structure Figure S32. Some of the quaternary ammonium-functionalized COF units were placed on the Cu 100 surface to form a heterojunction structure Figure 4a. The CO adsorption energies on Cu 100 and Cu 100Me- COF were calculated to be 1.12 eV and 1.33 eV, respectively, indicating stronger CO adsorption on the Cu 100Me-COF electrode, which is consistent with the experimental ATR-SEIRAS results Figures 4b and S33. Additionally, the free energy change for the rate-determining CC coupling process on the Cu 100Me-COF 0.75 eV was significantly lower than that on the Cu 100 surface 0.82 eV, further suggesting the promoting role of quaternary ammonium-functionalized COFs Figure 4c. In addition to studying the Cu 100 surface, we also computationally explored the Cu 111 surface, the more thermodynamically unfavorable surface for C2 production Figures S34S36, showing that the cationic COFs could still exhibit significant promoting effects. Together, these findings suggest that the COFs offer a promising strategy for tailoring the micro- environment for the CO2RR. CONCLUSIONS In summary, hydrophobic cationic COFs are shown to effectively manipulate the microenvironment with lower dynamic degree, enabling efficient CO2 electrocatalysis toward multicarbon products. The modification with hydrophobic cationic COFs leads to an impressive selectivity for C2H4 46.8 FE with a prominent partial current density of 374.2 mA cm2. The microporous and hydrophobic nature of the cationic COFs efficiently modulates CO2 and interfacial H2O transport. Meanwhile, the immobilized quaternary ammonium cations effectively regulate K migration via the Donnan effect and enhance the interfacial local electric field strength, increasing CO adsorption and promoting CC coupling. In a practical MEA electrolyzer, the CuMe-COF electrode could maintain 89.6 h of operation at 200 mA cm2 with no obvious decline in ethylene selectivity. Our study underscores the significance of microenvironment tailoring in CO2 electrolysis and provides valuable insights into the underlying functional mechanism of organic modifiers.

Herein, a series of NiOH2 samples with well-defined morphologies i.e., nanorod and nanosheet and crystal structures i.e., α and β phases were synthesized and evaluated for electrochemical conversion of KA oil. The catalytic performance of the samples was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry CV, linear sweep voltammetry LSV, and chronoamperometric tests. The products of KA oil oxidation were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography HPLC. Among the samples, the α- NiOH2 nanorod exhibited the best electrochemical activity, with a maximum current density of 17.6 mA mg1 at 1.57 V. Such superior activity is related to the large surface area and formation of active NiOOH at lower potentials. HPLC results indicate that the β-NiOH2 nanosheet exhibited the highest adipic acid selectivity of 26 at 1.63 V. Notably, the α-NiOH2 nanosheet shows both poor activity and product selectivity. Open-circuit potential OCP and double-layer capacitance Cdl measurements demonstrated that the adsorption capacity of KA oil over the samples follows the sequence of β-NiOH2 nanosheet α-NiOH2 nanorod α-NiOH2 nanosheet. Operando Raman and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy EIS results suggest that the oxidation of KA oil by the α-NiOH2 nanorod mainly follows the indirect oxidation mechanism, while the oxidation of KA oil by the α-NiOH2 nanosheet follows the direct oxidation mechanism. For the β-NiOH2 nanosheet, both direct and indirect oxidations of KA oil take place.

INTRODUCTION KA oil, composed of cyclohexanone K and cyclohexanol A, serves as a crucial platform chemical for the chemical industry. Adipic acid AA, obtained by oxidizing KA oil, is a major industrial chemical with an estimated annual value of ca. 6.3 billion worldwide.1,2 The substantial demand for AA can be attributed to its diverse applications in the chemical, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food processing industries.37 With technological advancements, the application scope of AA is expected to expand.8,9 In current industrial processes, the conversion of KA oil into AA is conducted by concentrated nitric acid using copperammonium metavanadate as the catalyst.4,10 However, this process exhibits a low yield of AA in a single production.11 Furthermore, this process involves the use of excess nitric acid, which leads to the generation of greenhouse gas N2O, causing ozone depletion, acid rain, and global warming.12 Obviously, developing a green and efficient method for AA synthesis is an urgent priority. The electro- chemical conversion of organic substrates into high-value- added compounds is regarded as a promising synthetic approach.1316 In a typical electrosynthesis process, electrons act as intrinsic clean reagents, utilizing water as the source of hydrogen or oxygen.

This approach eliminates the necessity for additional chemical oxidants, avoiding the use of toxic reagents.1719 Owing to the merits of environmental friend- liness, to date, electrochemical approaches have been studied for the synthesis of chemicals.2025 Electrocatalytic oxidation offers a green and efficient strategy for converting KA oil to AA.2628 High-performance electro- catalysts are essential for the application of electrochemical processes. Nickel-based catalysts are widely recognized as promising electrode materials due to exceptional catalytic properties, high natural abundance, and remarkable stabil- ity.2932 The earliest work on electro-oxidation of A to AA was reported by Lyalin and Petrosyan in 2004,33 where a nickel oxyhydroxide NiOOH catalyst achieved an AA yield of 11 via a two-step oxidation process when A was used as the Received: October 6, 2024 Revised: April 21, 2025 Accepted: May 21, 2025 Research Article pubs.acs.orgacscatalysis XXXX American Chemical Society 10591 https:doi.org10.1021acscatal.4c06137 ACS Catal. 2025, 15, 1059110600 Downloaded via TSINGHUA UNIV on June 15, 2025 at 07:46:55 UTC.

Since then, advancements have been achieved in the development of nickel-based catalysts for improving the catalytic performance, in terms of product selectivity and KA conversion. For example, Gong et al. demonstrated that introducing Cu2 into NiOH2 can effectively promote Cα-Cβ cleavage of A.20 Duans research group found that modifying NiOH2 with sodium dodecyl sulfonate SDS and vanadium V significantly improved catalytic performance because SDS facilitates K enrichment on the catalyst surface and V can accelerate catalyst reconstruction and strengthen K adsorption.26,34 Our group has recently reported a manganese-doped NiOH2 catalyst, which possessed good activity and product selectivity because manganese can modify the adsorption of the substrates.35 Jia et al. studied the mechanism of KA oil oxidation over the NiOH2 catalyst and found that Ni3 is responsible for A hydrogenation to K, while oxygen vacancy is crucial for the subsequent oxidation of K to AA.29 Though efforts have been devoted to this research topic, there are few studies on the dependence of KA oil oxidation on the morphology and crystal phase of NiOH2. In this study, we synthesized nickel hydroxides with controlled morphologies i.e., nanorod and nanosheet and crystal phases α and β phases for the electrochemical conversion of KA oil. The electrochemical measurements indicated that the α-NiOH2 nanorod α-NiOH2NR has the best electrochemical activity, yielding a maximum current density of 17.6 mA mg1 at 1.57 V. Additionally, operando electrochemical Raman spectra revealed that α-NiOH2NR exhibited a lower potential of 1.43 V for the formation active NiOOH. High- performance liquid chromatography HPLC results indicate that the β-NiOH2 nanosheet β-NiOH2NS exhibits the highest AA selectivity of 26 at 1.63 V.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1. Structural Characterization. The morphologies of the as-synthesized samples are characterized, as shown in Figure 1. In general, pH is critical for the phase stability of NiOH2 and a specific surfactant can alter the reaction interface and adjust the crystal growth direction. Consequently, control synthesis can be achieved by adjusting the pH and surfactant of the reaction system.36 Figure 1a,b illustrates the representative FESEM and TEM overview images of α- NiOH2NR, which exhibit a typical rod-like structure with an approximate diameter of 13 nm Figure S1a. The HRTEM image in Figure 1c reveals well-defined lattice fringes in α- NiOH2NR with a measured spacing of 0.218 nm in region 1. Correlating this observation with the standard card ICDD No. 00-022-0444 from the XRD database presented in Table S1, it can be determined that this lattice spacing corresponds to the 103 planes of α-NiOH2. As shown in Figure 1d,e, α-NiOH2NS exhibits a sheet-like morphology with an average lateral size of ca. 110 nm Figure S1b. HRTEM analysis Figure 1f further confirms the crystalline structure, where the measured lattice spacing of 0.219 nm in region 2 corresponds to the 103 planes of α-NiOH2. In contrast, β-NiOH2NS Figure 1g,h consists of smaller nanosheets ca. 58 nm, Figure S1c, and its HRTEM image Figure 1i reveals a distinct lattice spacing of 0.265 nm in region 3. Combined with the standard card ICDD No. 00- 001-1047 Table S2 of the XRD database, it can be inferred that this lattice spacing is ascribed to the 100 planes of β- NiOH2. These results indicate the successful synthesis of NiOH2 with well-defined morphologies. The XRD results of the as-synthesized samples are presented in Figure 1j. The diffraction peaks of β-NiOH2NS are well aligned with the standard card ICDD No. 00-001-1047, confirming the formation of the β-NiOH2 crystalline phase. Specifically, the diffraction peaks at ca. 19, 33.2, and 38.6 correspond to the 001, 100, and 101 crystal planes of β- NiOH2, respectively. The diffraction peaks of the α- NiOH2-NS sample can be indexed to the standard card ICDD No. 00-022-0444, demonstrating that",

Specifically, the diffraction peaks at ca. 19, 33.2, and 38.6 correspond to the 001, 100, and 101 crystal planes of β- NiOH2, respectively. The diffraction peaks of the α- NiOH2-NS sample can be indexed to the standard card ICDD No. 00-022-0444, demonstrating that the sample is primarily composed of α-NiOH2. Specifically, the peaks at ca. 11.6, 23, 33.7, 34.5, 38.9, and 59.9 correspond to the 001, 002, 110, 111, 103, and 300 crystal planes of α-NiOH2, respectively. However, a meticulous analysis indicates that several characteristic peaks in the XRD pattern do not align with the standard card, potentially due to the presence of a minor quantity of β-NiOH2. The synthesis of high-purity α-NiOH2 poses significant challenges.39 Like- wise, the XRD pattern of α-NiOH2-NR displays distinct peak shifts and broadening, which may be ascribed to the presence of β-NiOH2 impurities, variable hydration, and crystal defects.4042 Raman spectra were further employed to investigate the structural features of the samples, as illustrated in Figure 1k. The Raman results reveal significant differences in the characteristic peaks among the samples. According to group theory, β-NiOH2 exhibits four fundamental vibrational modes 2A1g 2Eg, which are typically observed in the spectral regions of 310318, 445453, and 3581 cm1.43 A meticulous analysis of the spectrum of β-NiOH2NS reveals characteristic peaks at 310 and 446 cm1, which are assigned to the EgR and A1gT vibrational modes of β-NiOH2, respectively.44 Additionally, the peak observed at 880 cm1 ACS Catalysis pubs.acs.orgacscatalysis Research Article https:doi.org10.1021acscatal.4c06137 ACS Catal. 2025, 15, 1059110600 10593 corresponds to the lattice vibration of β-NiOH2.39 In contrast, α-NiOH2 usually shows structural irregularities,45 resulting in some differences in the observed peaks. Upon thorough analysis of the spectrum of α-NiOH2NS, a characteristic peak at 470 cm1 is ascribed to the lattice vibration of α-NiOH2, whereas the peak at 1044 cm1 is attributed to the intercalation of NO3 ions between the layers. Additionally, the characteristic peak observed at ca. 1400 cm1 may be due to the splitting of the OH bending mode within the lattice OH caused by the structural disorder.46 The peak at ca. 490 cm1 in the α-NiOH2NR spectrum also arises from the α-NiOH2 lattice vibrations. Notably, the peaks observed at 451, 607, 986, and 1105 cm1 can be attributed to the intercalation of SO4 2in the sample. The N2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the samples were recorded to determine their specific surface areas, as illustrated in Figure 1l. Among the synthesized samples, α-NiOH2NR exhibits the largest BET surface area of 91.1 m2 g1, exceeding those of β-NiOH2NS 55.6 m2 g1 and α-NiOH2NS 6.6 m2 g1. 3.2. Electrochemical Performance. Since K and A share an identical reaction pathway and pure KA is rarely employed in industrial processes,20 we prepared KA oil by mixing equimolar quantities of K and A 1:1 to simulate industrial feedstock conditions. The electrochemical properties of the resulting samples were investigated by using cyclic voltamme- try CV and linear sweep voltammetry LSV. As shown in Figure 2a, the CV curve",

The electrochemical properties of the resulting samples were investigated by using cyclic voltamme- try CV and linear sweep voltammetry LSV. As shown in Figure 2a, the CV curve of α-NiOH2NR in 1 M KOH solutions reveals an oxidation peak at a potential of 1.42 V, corresponding to the oxidation of Ni2.26,29,47 As the scanning potential continues to increase, a rise in the current density is observed, signifying the onset of the oxygen evolution reaction OER. Similar characteristics are noted from the LSV curve see Figure 2e. Notably, following the addition of 0.1 M KA oil, a higher oxidation peak emerges at a potential of 1.56 V, which is attributed to the oxidation of the KA oil. Specifically, the peak current density for KA oil oxidation in the CV curve of α-NiOH2NR reaches 34.2 mA mg1. Correspondingly, a larger oxidation peak is observed in the LSV results at the same potential, as shown in Figure 2e. The occurrence of the OER subsequently initiates after the oxidation of KA oil, indicating that the oxidation of KA oil has a competitive advantage over the OER. The CV curve of α-NiOH2NS see Figure 2b, similar to that of α-NiOH2NR, exhibits an oxidation peak for Ni2 at 1.41 V in 1 M KOH solutions. After the addition of 0.1 M KA oil, a higher oxidation peak emerges at ca. 1.53 V, which is associated with the oxidation of KA oil. Compared to α-NiOH2NR, α-NiOH2NS demonstrates a lower current density for KA oil oxidation. Specifically, the CV curve indicates a current density of only 2.3 mA mg1 for KA oil oxidation. As depicted in Figure 2c, the CV curve of β- NiOH2NS in 1 M KOH solutions exhibits an oxidation peak at 1.46 V, indicative of the oxidation of Ni2. Upon the introduction of 0.1 M KA oil, the CV curve demonstrates the presence of a shoulder peak located at ca. 1.52 V, which is attributed to the oxidation of the KA oil. Compared to α- NiOH2NS, β-NiOH2NS demonstrates an increased current density for KA oil oxidation. Specifically, the peak current density for KA oil oxidation in the CV curve of the β- NiOH2NS sample is 4.5 mA mg1. Previous studies have confirmed the irreversible phase transition from α-NiOH2 to β-NiOH2 in alkaline solutions, especially under electrochemical conditions.48,49 To evaluate the stability of α-NiOH2NS under the operational conditions, TEM characterization of the catalyst after 4 h electrolysis at 1.63 V was performed.

Additionally, after 4 h electrolysis, CV tests of 100 cycles see Figure S2b were performed, which exhibited negligible peak potential shifts, further proving the structural stability of α-NiOH2NS in 1 M KOH 0.1 M KA oil solutions. Figure 2d compares the LSV curves of the three samples in 1 M KOH with and without 0.1 M KA oil solutions. In the absence of KA oil, all three samples show similar OER characteristics, with an onset potential of ca. 1.51 V following a weak peak associated with the oxidation of Ni2 ca. 1.39 V. Notably, α-NiOH2NS has a low current density due to its small BET surface area Figure 1l. Upon KA oil addition, the current densities of the samples increase, and the onset potential of KA oil oxidation is much lower than that of the OER, indicating that KA oil oxidation is more favorable than the OER. The α-NiOH2NR catalysts exhibited a peak current density of 17.6 mA mg1, substantially outperforming both β-NiOH2NS 5.05 mA mg1 and α-NiOH2NS 1.71 mA mg1. The introduction of KA oil significantly accelerated the reaction kinetics of α-NiOH2NR, manifested by shifting the polarization curve toward lower voltages by 156 mV at a current density of 5 mA mg1. The energy efficiency of KA oxidation by α-NiOH2NS and β-NiOH2NS is also superior relative to that of the OER see Figure 2e. Meanwhile, the Tafel slopes of the samples were determined Figure 2f. Specifically, the Tafel slope values for OER and KA oil oxidation of α-NiOH2NS are 85.9 and 53.7 mV dec1, respectively, which are lower than those of α-NiOH2 NR 87.7 and 57.8 mV dec1 and β-NiOH2NS 98.4 and 107.9 mV dec1. 3.3. Analysis of Products. To determine the products of KA oil electro-oxidation, an electrolysis process was conducted in an H-type cell. The concentration of the products and substrates was analyzed by HPLC. First, cyclohexanol A, cyclohexanone K, and several possible carboxylic acids, including adipic acid AA, glutaric acid GA, and succinic acid SA, were identified by HPLC, and a variety of standard curves were established to accurately determine their concentrations see Figures S3, S4a, and S5a. It should be pointed out that AA, GA, and SA are the most desirable products from the oxidation of KA oil. However, some other byproducts could be possibly present in the electrolytes but not analyzed in this work. In addition, to verify the degradation of KA oil in 1 M KOH solutions without electrolysis, 50 mM KA oil was placed under the same",

In addition, to verify the degradation of KA oil in 1 M KOH solutions without electrolysis, 50 mM KA oil was placed under the same reaction conditions without performing electrolysis at various times. As shown in Figure S6, the conversion rates of KA oil after 2, 4, and 20 h were 0.9, 1.6, and 5.3, respectively. This extremely low degradation rate is considered to be negligible. Furthermore, no degradation products were detected at the 4 h time point, confirming that the observed degradation had no significant impact on the experimental results. The conversion of KA oil and resulting products obtained from the samples are shown in Figures 3ac and S4bd. In the process of KA oil oxidation, the electrolysis potential is one of the important factors that influences product distribution. Understanding the effects of electrolysis potential on product distribution is desirable for rational control of the target product. Thus, the product distribution of KA oil oxidation by the three catalysts at different applied potentials was investigated. α-NiOH2NR yields AA selectivities of 7.4, 11.0, and 14.1 at applied potentials of 1.43, 1.53, and 1.63 V, respectively. Notably, no GA was detected at 1.43 V, while GA selectivities of 7.98 and 10.3 were obtained at 1.53 and 1.63 Figure 3. Analysis of the Products of KA oil oxidation by the as-synthesized catalysts.

The α-NiOH2NS yields AA selectivities of 5.8, 10.3, and 16.3 at 1.43, 1.53, and 1.63 V, respectively. No GA was detected at 1.43 V, while GA selectivities of 7.6 and 23.7 were obtained at 1.53 and 1.63 V, respectively. At 1.63 V, α- NiOH2NS yields a SA selectivity of 6.2. The β-NiOH2 NS yields AA selectivities of 6.3, 22.9, and 26.0 at 1.43, 1.53, and 1.63 V, respectively. Similarly, no detection of GA was observed at 1.43 V, while GA selectivities of 6.6 and 9.1 were obtained at 1.53 and 1.63 V, respectively. Additionally, SA was observed only at 1.63 V, with a selectivity value of 4.2. The results presented above suggest that the selectivity for AA, GA, and SA of the three catalysts increases with an increasing applied potential. At 1.63 V, the ranking of AA selectivity among the three catalysts follows the sequence of β-NiOH2 NS α-NiOH2NR α-NiOH2NS. Consequently, β- NiOH2NS exhibits the most optimal AA selectivity of 26.0 at 1.63 V for 4 h electrolysis. This could be related to the adsorption of the substrates and intermediates. As illustrated",

Consequently, β- NiOH2NS exhibits the most optimal AA selectivity of 26.0 at 1.63 V for 4 h electrolysis. This could be related to the adsorption of the substrates and intermediates. As illustrated in Figures 3d and S5bd, the conversion of KA oil at varying potentials aligns with the aforementioned observations. Briefly, as the applied potential increases, the KA oil conversion of the samples also rises. However, a close inspection could reveal that the KA oil conversion of α- NiOH2NS at 1.53 V does not exhibit a significant increase compared to 1.43 V, while there is a notable increase in product selectivity, potentially attributed to the fact that α- NiOH2NS produced more byproducts at 1.43 V. Notably, β-NiOH2NS exhibits the highest conversion of 30.9 at 1.63 V for 4 h electrolysis, which may be due to the fact that the main exposed crystal plane in β-NiOH2NS is 100, while that in α-NiOH2NR and α-NiOH2NS is 103 as shown in Figure 1c,f,i. The results show that the NiOH2 Figure 4.

To further explore the effects of substrate concentration on the product distribution of KA oil oxidation, chronoamperometric tests were conducted for 4 h in the electrolytes with varying KA oil concentrations at 1.63 V. The products of KA oil oxidation and KA oil conversion obtained from the β-NiOH2NS are illustrated in Figures 3e, S4e, and S5e. AA selectivity of the sample increases from 16.6 to 26.0 as the substrate concentration gradually increases from 10 to 50 mM and decreases with a further increase in substrate concentration to 100 mM, leading to a maximum value of 50 mM. Using 50 mM KA oil as the substrate, the selectivity for side products such as GA and SA is quite limited. With the increase of substrate concentration, the conversion rate of KA oil shows little variation, indicating that within the range of 25100 mM, the conversion of KA oil by β- NiOH2NS is not dependent on substrate concentration. These findings suggest that a substrate concentration of 50 mM is optimal for the selective oxidation of KA oil into AA on the electrode surface, which could be related to the adsorption of the substrates on the electrode",

These findings suggest that a substrate concentration of 50 mM is optimal for the selective oxidation of KA oil into AA on the electrode surface, which could be related to the adsorption of the substrates on the electrode surface and subsequent oxidation kinetics.29 In addition, β-NiOH2NS was used to perform constant potential electrolysis of KA oil at 1.63 V for 10 h. The product distribution and KA oil conversion at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h are illustrated in Figures 3f, S4f, and S5f. Throughout the electrolysis, AA is the primary product of KA oil oxidation, and the selectivities of AA, GA, and SA increase with electrolysis time. Specifically, the selectivity of AA is increased from 9.1 to 27.0. The conversion of KA oil also increases with time, reaching 57.5 after 10 h of electrolysis. Within the initial 2 h of electrolysis, the selectivity of AA exhibits a rapid increase, reaching 17.7. However, during the subsequent period of 210 h, AA selectivity slowly increases. Instead, the selectivity of the byproducts, including GA and SA, has demonstrated a steady increase during this period. Notably, the maximum selectivity for GA reaches 15.0. 3.4. Mechanistic Studies on KA Oil Electro-Oxidation. To gain insights into the mechanism of KA oil oxidation, the adsorption behavior of KA oil over the catalysts was first studied by measuring the OCP, which reflects the variation of absorbates within the Helmholtz layer.51 In 1 M KOH solutions, the primary adsorbed species are typically water molecules and K and OHions. As shown in Figure 4a, β- NiOH2NS exhibits the highest OCP before the addition of KA oil, likely resulting from its smallest electrochemical active surface area ECSA and, therefore, the least adsorption of these species. However, upon the introduction of KA oil, the adsorbed species expanded to include water molecules and K, OH, and KA oil molecules in solution. Consequently, the observed difference in the OCP can be attributed to the adsorption of KA oil molecules. Specifically, after KA oil was injected, a more noticeable decrease in OCP of the β- NiOH2NS electrode Δ 395 mV was detected compared with those of α-NiOH2NR Δ 270 mV and α-NiOH2 NS Δ 112 mV, revealing that the absorption capacity of KA oil over the three samples follows the order of β-NiOH2 NS α-NiOH2NR α-NiOH2NS. In addition, Raman spectra were used to investigate the adsorption properties of the samples see Figure S7a. For clarity, the Raman spectra of KA oil, K, and A solutions and carbon paper were also recorded see Figure S7b. The band assignments were made by referencing established experimental and theoretical studies.52,53 In 1 M KOH solutions, no other peaks are noted, except those of carbon supports. In contrast, additional peaks at 2863, 2907, and 2951 cm1 are noted in 1 M KOH 0.1 M KA oil solutions, which were attributed to the vibration of CH groups from the carbon rings, indicative of the adsorption of",

Within the non-Faradaic region, the CV curves were recorded at varying scan rates, as shown in Figures S8 and S9. The current at the anodic sweep ia and cathodic sweep ic were recorded, and their difference Δi was determined by Δi ia ic2. The slope of the linear fitting of Δi against the scan rate corresponded to the value of Cdl see Figure 4b,c. The Cdl values of α-NiOH2NR, α-NiOH2NS, and β- NiOH2NS in 1 M KOH 0.1 M KA oil solutions are 3.11, 3.45, and 2.84 μF, respectively. The ECSA was derived by dividing the Cdl by the specific capacitance Cs 40 μF cm2.54,55 The ECSA values of the samples were determined to be 0.078, 0.086, and 0.071 cm2, respectively, which primarily arise from crystallographic phase effects and morphological differences.50 Specifically, the α-NiOH2NS samples exhibit a loosely stacked layered structure compared to that of β- NiOH2NS, and the NiOH2 nanosheets typically possess a higher density of exposed edge sites and structural defects compared to nanorods, contributing to the enhanced ECSA despite their larger lateral size. To verify the potential influence of surface modification induced by urea on the ECSA of α- NiOH2NS, the Cdl values of α-NiOH2NS in 1 M KOH 0.1 M KA oil 0.05 M urea solutions were also determined. The resulting value was compared with that obtained in 1 M KOH 0.1 M KA oil solutions, as shown in Figure S10. Specifically, the Cdl of α-NiOH2NS exhibits a slight increase from 3.45 to 3.56 μF upon adding urea, suggesting that urea had little effect on the ECSA of α-NiOH2NS. Notably, the catalytic activity of the samples does not correlate well with their Cdl values, suggesting that the catalytic oxidation activity of the samples toward KA oil is determined by factors beyond the ECSA. To reveal the intrinsic activity, the ECSA- normalized current density was plotted against potential, as shown in Figure S11a. Figure S11b comparatively shows the intrinsic activity of the three samples for KA oil oxidation and the OER. Interestingly, the ECSA-normalized current density of the three samples follows the order of α-NiOH2NR β- NiOH2NS α-NiOH2NS, which is consistent with that of mass-normalized current density see Figure 2d,e. However, the BET surface area-normalized current density of the three samples follows the sequence of α-NiOH2NS α- NiOH2NR β-NiOH2NS see Figure S12, which is due to the fact that α-NiOH2NS with a loosely stacked layered structure exhibits the smallest BET surface area and",

This behavior aligns with previous reports where catalysts with moderate BET surface areas but optimized nanostructures, e.g., Fe-LNO and HCSNi,56,57 exhibit exceptional ECSA. The Cdl values of the catalysts in 1 M KOH solutions were also determined. The resulting values were compared with ACS Catalysis pubs.acs.orgacscatalysis Research Article https:doi.org10.1021acscatal.4c06137 ACS Catal. 2025, 15, 1059110600 10597 those obtained in 1 M KOH 0.1 M KA oil solutions, as shown in Figure 4b. Specifically, the Cdl of β-NiOH2NS exhibits an increase from 2.59 to 2.84 μF upon adding KA oil, suggesting that β-NiOH2NS shows superior adsorption for KA oil. The difference between the two Cdl values ΔCdl follows the sequence of β-NiOH2NS 0.25 μF α- NiOH2NR 0.17 μF α-NiOH2NS 0.02 μF, indicating the variations in the adsorption capacity of KA oil over the three catalysts, which is consistent with the findings from the OCP tests. Moreover, capacitive measurements were applied to explore the adsorption of KA oil over the catalysts. The adsorption of KA oil onto the catalyst surface would modify the structures of the electric double layer, which in turn leads to variations in the interfacial capacitance.24 As illustrated in Figure S13, both β-NiOH2NS and α-NiOH2NR exhibit notable reductions in capacitance upon the addition of KA oil. In contrast, the capacitance of α-NiOH2NS shows the smallest change, demonstrating that among the three samples, α-NiOH2NS displays the lowest adsorption capacity for KA oil. To reveal the active sites of the as-synthesized samples for the electro-oxidation of KA oil, operando electrochemical Raman spectroscopy was employed Figure 4di. In 1 M KOH solutions, the Raman spectrum of α-NiOH2NR recorded at 1.63 V displays two weak peaks centered at ca. 487.5 and 562.7 cm1, which are attributed to Ni3-O bending and stretching vibrations, respectively,29,5860 as evidenced in Figure 4d. In 1 M KOH 0.1 M KA oil electrolyte, the formation of NiOOH occurs at 1.43 V, as confirmed by the appearance of two characteristic peaks at ca. 479.8 and 556.4 cm1 see Figure 4g. α-NiOH2NR exhibits a lower potential for the formation of NiOOH in the presence of KA oil, suggesting that KA oil significantly facilitates the reconstruction of α-NiOH2NR. Notably, vigorous bubble generation was observed at the potentials exceeding 1.63 V, blocking the objective lens and consequently resulting in the disappearance of Raman peaks.34 The Raman spectra of α- NiOH2NS were collected at varying potentials as shown in Figure 4e,h. The absence of Raman signals related to Ni3-O bending and stretching vibrations indicates that Ni2 oxidation in α-NiOH2NS is difficult, aligning with the LSV data. As shown in Figure 4f, β-NiOH2NS requires a lower applied potential 1.53 V to form NiOOH in 1 M KOH solutions compared",

As shown in Figure 4f, β-NiOH2NS requires a lower applied potential 1.53 V to form NiOOH in 1 M KOH solutions compared with α-NiOH2NR. In contrast, in the presence of KA oil, NiOOH formation occurred at a higher potential 1.63 V, likely due to the excellent adsorption of β-NiOH2NS for KA oil.26,47,61 To further investigate the KA oil electro-oxidation kinetics and interfacial behaviors, operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy EIS measurements were conducted.27 Figure S14 shows the Bode plots recorded in 1 M KOH 0.1 M KA oil solutions. The high-frequency response 101105 Hz is typically associated with the processes taking place in the inner electrode,62 including the electro-oxidation of the catalyst surface. The low-frequency region 102101 Hz reflects the nonhomogeneous charge distribution, such as the appearance of surface-adsorbed species at the interface.27 The Bode plots of the samples exhibit a characteristic peak at ca. 1 Hz, emerging at 1.23 V, showing a negative phase shift with increasing applied potential. On the basis of LSV results, this peak is ascribed to the adsorption of OH.35 Subsequently, characteristic peaks appear in the direction of higher phase angles, which is related to the oxidation of the KA oil. Specifically, the potentials of KA oxidation of α-NiOH2NR 1.53 V, α-NiOH2NS 1.49 V, and β-NiOH2NS 1.47 V are shown in Figure S15, corresponding to their respective KA oil oxidation peaks at 1.56, 1.53, and 1.52 V in the CV curves see Figure 2ac. According to the report of Bender et al., there are two pathways, namely, direct oxidation and indirect oxidation mechanisms for KA oxidation by NiOH2.61 The detailed mechanism of KA oxidation is closely related to the valence state of the nickel species. To address this issue, the potentials of NiOOH formation determined from operando electro- chemical Raman spectra see Figure 4gi are compared with those of KA oil oxidation derived from operando EIS see Figure S14, and CV results see Figure 2ac, as shown in Figure S15. The oxidation of KA oil by α-NiOH2NR occurred after the formation of NiOOH species, indicating an indirect oxidation pathway. No Raman signals related to the formation of active NiOOH intermediates were detected from α-NiOH2NS in 1 M KOH 0.1 M KA oil solutions, indicating that the oxidation of KA oil by α-NiOH2NS could follow a direct oxidation pathway. In contrast, the oxidation of KA oil by the β-NiOH2NS sample preceded the formation of NiOOH, suggesting that the oxidation process could possibly involve both direct and indirect oxidation mechanisms. 4. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, three NiOH2 samples, including α-NiOH2 NR, β-NiOH2NS, and α-NiOH2NS, with well-defined morphology and crystal structures were evaluated for electro- chemical conversion of KA oil. α-NiOH2NR had the best electrochemical activity, with a maximum current density of 17.6 mA mg1 at 1.57 V, which was significantly higher than those of β-NiOH2NS and α-NiOH2NS.

This may be related to the fact that α-NiOH2NR exhibited a lower potential of 1.43 V for the formation of NiOOH as compared to those of β-NiOH2NS 1.63 V and α-NiOH2NS no Raman signals for Ni3-O in 1 M KOH 0.1 M KA oil solutions. HPLC analysis indicated that β-NiOH2NS exhibited the highest AA selectivity of 26 at 1.63 V. The superior AA selectivity of β-NiOH2NS could be attributed to the adsorptions of the substrates and intermediates. In contrast, α-NiOH2NS showed poor electrochemical activity and product selectivity. OCP and Cdl measurements demonstrated that the adsorption capacity of KA oil over the three samples followed the sequence of β-NiOH2NS α- NiOH2NR α-NiOH2NS. Furthermore, operando Raman and EIS results suggest that the oxidation of KA oil by α-NiOH2NR mainly follows the indirect oxidation pathway, while the oxidation of KA oil by α-NiOH2NS follows the direct oxidation pathway. For β-NiOH2NS, both direct and indirect oxidation of KA oil takes place. This work clearly revealed the effects of structural features of NiOH2 on the electrochemical conversion of KA oil, which could be of significance for fabricating advanced catalysts for the oxidation of KA oil.

Herein, we realize an efficient ethanol electrosynthesis by coating Cu catalysts with β-hydroxy ketone-based covalent organic polymers COPCOOH, which not only activate CO2 but also balance the CHOCO flux at the catalystelectrolyte interface. The COPCOOH coated Cu NPs CuCOPCOOH exhibits unprecedented FEEtOH of 54.2 in 0.5 M KHCO3, with a partial current density of 121.3 mA cm2. Crucially, using a dilute CO2 feedstock 20 CO2, it retains 40.8 FEEtOH, circumventing energy-intensive CO2 purification. Through systematic experimental characterizations and density functional theory DFT calculations, we elucidate a unique organic motif synergy: carbonyl groups serve as CO2 activation centers, while adjacent hydroxyl groups boost H supply for CO protonation to CHO intermediates. This unique synergy enables a balanced CHOCO flux, thereby creating an optimal environment favoring asymmetric CHOCO coupling and preferentially stabilizing the CHCOH intermediate toward ethanol production. Our investigations establish a universal design paradigm to bypass scaling relations in CO2RR through organic motif synergy, offering atomistic insights into steering complex reaction networks in CO2 electroreduction. INTRODUCTION The use of CO2, water, and renewable electricity as direct feedstocks for synthesizing dense-energy carriers offers a sustainable pathway to decarbonize energy systems while reducing fossil fuel dependence.1,2 Particularly promising in this context is the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction CO2RR, which enables the storage of intermittent renewable energy sources and the production of carbon-neutral fuels and chemicals, such as ethanol.3,4 However, achieving exclusive ethanol generation via the CO2RR remains a substantial challenge rooted in the complex proton-coupled electron transfer PCET process.5,6 Despite substantial progress has been made in catalyst design, the Faradaic efficiency for ethanol FEEtOH still falls short of industrial requirements.7,8 Moreover, nearly all reported CO2RR systems rely on pure CO2, whose production costs 70100 per ton from industrial waste gases significantly undermine process economics.9 To address these limitations, further advances in ethanol-oriented CO2RR electrocatalysts, especially those operating under dilute CO2 streams, are in a pressing need. Beyond manipulating the composition and structure of Cu- based catalysts, rational regulation of interfacial microenviron- ments has emerged as a pivotal strategy to enhance CO2RR performance toward ethanol production.1012 In particular, incorporating organic functional motifs at the reaction interface exerts a profound influence on CO2 to ethanol kinetics by tailoring intermediates adsorption and interfacial water micro- environment.13,14 For instance, superhydrophobic polymers have been shown to elevate the local CO2H2O ratio at the Cu surface, thereby directing the reaction pathway toward ethanol formation.15 Beyond mass transfer control, organic functional motifs can directly",

This mechanism not only enhances CO2 activation kinetics but also holds promise for concentrating CO2 at catalytic sites under dilute feed conditions. However, while hydrophobic organic layers improve CO2 enrichment, they concurrently reduce interfacial water content, leading to insufficient proton availability that hinders the thermodynamically favorable asymmetric CHOCO coupling.19 To address this, recent studies highlight the role of hydroxyl motifs in enabling hydrogen-bond-assisted proton delivery20 and providing extra stabilization capability toward oxygen-containing intermediates in CO2RR systems,21 which are pivotal for ethanol forma- tion.22,23 Building on these insights, it is postulated that integrating dual-functional organic motifscombining carbonyl groups for CO2 activation and hydroxyl groups for proton deliverycould synergistically optimize the interfacial micro- environment toward high-efficiency ethanol production from dilute CO2 streams. In this contribution, we designed a β-hydroxy ketone-based covalent organic polymer COPCOOH overlayer on Cu nanoparticles to address the dual challenges of CO2 activation and proton supply in the ethanol-selective CO2RR under dilute CO2 conditions. The CuCOPCOOH composite achieves an exceptional FEEtOH of 54.2 with an ethanol partial current density jEtOH of 121.3 mA cm2 in neutral electrolyte, while maintaining 40.8 FEEtOH under a dilute CO2 feed 20 CO2. Mechanistic investigations uncover a cooperative interfacial synergy: the carbonyl groups function as a molecular antenna to concentrate CO2 and accelerate CO2 formation, while hydroxyl moieties establish hydrogen-bond interactions that facilitate water dissociation kinetics, ensuring an efficient H supply for CO protonation to CHO. This dual functionality synergistically optimizes the CHOCO ratio and directs the asymmetric CC coupling for ethanol production. By harmonizing CO2 enrichment and proton delivery at the organicinorganic interface, this study pioneers a molecularly tailored approach to valorize waste CO2 streams into sustainable ethanol, bridging the gap between laboratory-scale innovation and industrial feasibility. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Theoretical Predictions on the Functional Motifs Synergy in CO2RR. The investigation begins by employing density functional theory DFT to probe how carbonyl and hydroxyl motifs regulate elementary steps associated with ethanol generation in the CO2RR. Initially, we model the adsorption behavior of CO2 on these COPs: COPOH hydroxyl- only, COPCO carbonyl-only, and COPCOOH dual-func- tional, represented by 1,3-diphenylpropan-1-ol, 1,3-diphenyl- propan-1-one, and 3-hydroxy-1,3-diphenylpropan-1-one, re- spectively.

Initially, we model the adsorption behavior of CO2 on these COPs: COPOH hydroxyl- only, COPCO carbonyl-only, and COPCOOH dual-func- tional, represented by 1,3-diphenylpropan-1-ol, 1,3-diphenyl- propan-1-one, and 3-hydroxy-1,3-diphenylpropan-1-one, re- spectively. As shown in Figure 1a, the dual-functional COPCOOH exhibits the strongest CO2 binding 0.126 eV vs 0.103 eV for COPOH and 0.114 eV for COPCO, with adsorption configurations showing cooperative COCO2 and OHCO2 interactions Figure S1. Such synergistic binding not only facilitates CO2 enrichment at the catalytic interface but also weakens the CO bonds of adsorbed CO2, priming it for subsequent activation. Given the critical role of H2O dissociation in generating H for driving CO2 deep reduction,24 we systematically investigate the H2O dissociation kinetics on COP-modified Cu surfaces. Models are constructed by grafting representative COP units onto the thermodynamically favorable Cu 111 surface, designating as Cu111COPCO, Cu111COPOH, and Cu111COPCOOH, respectively Figures S2S4. The free energy diagram Figure 1b reveals a dramatic reduction in the H2O dissociation barrier: 0.31 eV Cu111COPCO 0.14 eV Cu111COPOH 0.11 eV Cu111COPCOOH. This trend confirms that the OH moieties dominate H generation, and the synergistic interplay between CO and OH in COPCOOH shifts H2O dissociation on Cu111 from endothermic to exothermic. To rationalize this synergy, we analyze the atomic configurations of H2O adsorption over these Figure 1.

As presented in Table S1, the HOH linkage elongation aligns with the trend of the energy barrier for water dissociation, supporting the idea that the CO and OH interplay could polarize the HOH bond and expedite its dissociation. Beyond H generation, we further investigate the CO hydrogenation to CHOa critical intermediate for asym- metric CHOCO couplinggiven its thermodynamic pref- erence over CO dimerization.25,26 DFT results Figures S6 S8 reveal that the CO to CHO energy barrier decreases progressively from Cu111COPCO 0.43 eV to Cu111- COPOH 0.40 eV and Cu111COPCOOH 0.14 eV Figure 1c, consistent with the trend of H generation. This suggests that enhanced H flux holds the potential to elevate CHO coverage, thereby creating a kinetically favorable landscape for asymmetric coupling. To validate this, we modeled asymmetric CHOCO coupling on CHO-preloaded Cu111 surfaces: pristine Cu111, Cu111-19CHO one CHO per 3 3 slab, and Cu111-29CHO two CHO Figure S9.

Free energy profiles Figure 1d indicate that the asymmetric CHOCO coupling becomes energetically more favorable as CHO coverage increases, confirming that COPCOOH-mediated CHO enrichment thermodynamically steers CC coupling. Subsequently, to elucidate how CHO governs the selectivity bifurcation between ethanol and ethylene, we scrutinize the reaction energetics of CHCOHa pivotal branching inter- mediate dictating C2 product distribution.21,27,28 Reaction energy landscapes from CHCOH to CCH ethylene pathway, ΔG1 versus CHCHOH ethanol pathway, ΔG2 are mapped across CHO-modified Cu111 surfaces Figure S10. On pristine Cu111, ΔG1 is lower than ΔG2, indicating an intrinsic preference for ethylene formation Figure S11a. However, the incorporation of CHO dramatically reshapes this preference. On Cu111-19CHO, ΔG2 registers at 0.16 eV, nearly matching ΔG1 0.17 eV Figure S11b. Further increasing CHO coverage Cu111-29CHO amplifies this trend, driving ΔG2 drops to 0.21 eV while ΔG1 remains nearly constant at 0.17 eV Figure S11c. We quantify the ethanol selectivity bias using the energy difference descriptor- ΔG2ΔG1, where increasingly negative values signify stronger ethanol preference. As depicted in Figure 1e, the energy disparity becomes more negative with higher CHO coverage, suggesting that CHO enrichment steers the reaction toward ethanol generation. To unravel the mechanistic basis for preferential ethanol formation, we conduct charge distribution analysis of CHCOH adsorption on Cu111 and Cu111-29CHO Figure S12. An intensified charge transfer is observed on Cu111-2 9CHO Figure 1f, indicative of enhanced CHCOH stabilization. Atomic-level electronic configurations reveal that CHO coadsorption induces pronounced charge redistribution within CHCOH Figure 1g, localizing electron density around the C2O1 bond. This electronic reconfiguration shortens the C2O1 bond length from 1.374 Å pristine Cu to 1.371 Å Cu111-29CHO, strengthening the CO linkage and thermodynamically favoring ethanol formation over ethylene. Taken together, these DFT calculations establish that OH and CO moieties in COPCOOH synergistically elevate CHO coverage via carbonyl-mediated CO2 activation and Figure 2. a Schematic procedure for COPs preparation. b FT-IR spectra, and c 13C NMR spectra of COPs.

This elevated CHO coverage not only promotes asymmetric CHOCO coupling but also preferentially reinforces the CO linkage in the CHCOH intermediate, effectively steering the reaction toward ethanol. Design, Synthesis, and Characterization of COPs with Targeted Functional Motifs. As a proof of concept, COPOH, COPCO, and COPCOOH are constructed via a simple aldol reaction. As shown in Figure 2a, COPOHCO is synthesized through the base-catalyzed self-condensation of 1,3,5-triacetyl- benzene TAB. COPCO is obtained via the condensation of TAB and terephthalaldehyde TPA, while COPOH is subsequently derived from COPCO through selective carbonyl reduction using NaBH4.29 The molecular structures of these COPs are verified by Fourier-transform infrared FT-IR spectroscopy and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance 13C NMR analysis.

Noteworthy, COPCOOH exhibits distinct CO 1670 cm1 and OH 3360 cm1 stretching modes, confirming its β-hydroxy ketone architecture. The absence of the OH stretching vibrations in COPCO and the near-complete disappearance of the CO signals in COPOH after NaBH4 reduction align with the designed molecular architectures. Furthermore, the CO and OH stretching vibrations in COPCOOH are red-shifted Figure S13, which can be attributed to the elongation of CO and OH bonds arising from intramolecular hydrogen bonding CO HO within the β-hydroxy ketone framework Figure S14 and Table S2.30,31 The attenuated CO bond strength may enhance its reducibility to COunder electrochemical operation, which contributes to CO2 activation to form CO2 intermediates. 13C NMR Figure 2c further validates the structures: COPCOOH displays both ketone carbonyl δ 175 ppm and hydroxyl-bearing carbons δ 70 ppm, while COPCO retains only carbonyl signals and COPOH shows only hydroxyl-associated carbons. Together, these spectroscopic analyses unambiguously confirm the successful synthesis of target COPs with precise functional motif control. CO2RR Performance over COPs-Coated Cu NPs. With these COPs successfully synthesized, we next evaluate their role in modulating CO2RR kinetics by integrating them with commercial Cu NPs.

Prior to the performance evaluation, these composites were characterized to assess the impact of COPs on their physicochemical characteristics. A combination of SEM, XRD, and XPS analyses Figure S15 and Supplementary Note 1 confirmed that the COP coating does not alter the Cu NPs morphology, crystalline structure, or electronic properties. This eliminates the potential alteration in catalytic performance arising from structural or electronic factors, ensuring that observed catalytic differences are solely attributable to the functional motifs in COPs.

Initially, linear sweep voltammetry LSV under continuous CO2 flow showed higher current density for these COPs-coated Cu NPs compared to argon-saturated conditions Figure S17, validating their intrinsic CO2 electroreduction activity. Notably, COPs-coated Cu NPs exhibits suppressed hydrogen evolution reaction HER currents, attributed to enhanced hydro- phobicity reducing water accessibility at the catalyst-electrolyte interface contact angle increase from 46 to 120, Figure S18. Moreover, COPs-coated Cu NPs displays a lower CO2RR current density than pristine Cu NPs, which might be aroused from the sacrificed electrochemical active surface areas ECSA due to polymer coating. This hypothesis is validated by double- layer capacitance Cdl measurements Figure S19 and Table S3, showing nearly halved ECSA for COP-coated catalysts. Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy EIS reveals that COPs-coated Cu NPs exhibits higher charge transfer resistance Figure S20, which can be explained by the inherent insulating nature of these COPs. Next, the CO2RR performance of these COPs-coated Cu NPs is systematically evaluated from 0.8 to 1.6 VRHE with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode, without iR compensation. Figure 3ac summarizes the potential-dependent product distributions on these COPs-coated Cu NPs. As expected, COPs coatings universally suppress the parasitic HER, reducing the Faradaic efficiency of H2 FE H2 by more than 34.5 1.2 VRHE compared to pristine Cu NPs Figures S21 and S22. Meanwhile, C2 product selectivity is significantly enhanced, with the Faradaic efficiency for C2 products FE C2 reaching 44.5 CuCOPCO, 50.7 CuCOPOH, and 73.9 Cu COPCOOH at 1.2 VRHE, far exceeding that of pristine Cu NPs 35.6 Figure S23a. Notably, CuCOPCO exhibits a higher CO Faradaic efficiency FECO than pristine Cu NPs across the entire potential range Figure S23b, which aligns with the carbonyl groups role in facilitating CO2 activation. Of interest, FECO on CuCOPOH and CuCOPCOOH exhibit an inverted trend compared with that of CuCOPCO and Cu NPs. This inversion reflects accelerated CO depletion via hydroxyl- assisted protonation or CC coupling, a behavior consistent with DFT predictions. Moreover, it should be noted that the FEEtOH of CuCOPOH and CuCOPCOOH significantly surpasses that of CuCOPCO Figures 3d and S24, underscoring the pivotal role of hydroxyl motifs in heightening ethanol selectivity.28,32 The dual-func- tional CuCOPCOOH achieves dominance in ethanol produc- tion, reaching an impressive FEEtOH of 54.2 at 1.2 VRHE, with an ethanol partial current density jEtOH of 121.3 mA cm2 Figure 3e, corresponding to a production rate of 257.9 μmol h1cm2 Figure S25. To isolate intrinsic activity from surface area effects, we normalize the jEtOH by ECSA. As shown in Figure S26, the ECSA-normalized jEtOH follows the trend Cu NPs Cu COPCO CuCOPOH CuCOPCOOH, directly linking the C OOH synergy to enhanced intrinsic activity for CO2-to- ethanol conversion.

When benchmarked against state-of-the-art catalysts operating in near-neutral electrolytes, our Cu COPCOOH composite ranks among the top performers in both FEEtOH and jEtOH Figure 3f and Table S4. This superior performance stems from the cooperative interplay of CO- driven CO2 activation and OH-mediated CO protonation, which collectively steers the reaction pathway toward asym- metric CHOCO coupling for ethanol generation. To validate the universal catalytic enhancement of COPCOOH, we integrate it with two well-established CO2RR electrocatalystsAg nanoparticles NPs, CO-selective and Cu2O nanocubes NCs, C2-selective fabrication details in Supplementary Note 2 and Figure S27. For Ag NPs, COPCOOH coating increases FECO along with a decrease in the FEH2 Figure S28, confirming its role in CO2 activation. In the case of pristine Cu2O NCs, the COPCOOH coating shifts selectivity from ethylene-dominated FEEtOH 20, FEEtOH FEethylene ratio fluctuating between 0.4 and 1.0 to ethanol- preferred peak FEEtOH 38, with an optimal FEEtOHFEethylene ratio of 2.74 Figure S29. From these observations, we experimentally demonstrate that COPCOOH not only contrib- utes to CO2 activation but also plays a crucial role in optimizing key elementary steps associated with ethanol generation in the CO2RR. The long-lasting performance of the CuCOPCOOH catalyst is assessed in a membrane electrode assembly MEA under industrially relevant conditions 100 mA cm2. While the FEEtOH in the MEA catholyte-free operation is lower than in flow cells due to inherent challenges in precisely quantifying liquid products,33,34 the CuCOPCOOH composite maintains stable FEEtOH fluctuating around 30 over 100 h, out- performing Cu NPs, whose FEEtOH attenuates from 8.7 to 3.5 in 40 h Figure 3g. Postanalysis of the spent catalyst reveals minimal aggregation in CuCOPCOOH, whereas severe aggregation occurs in uncoated Cu NPs Figure S30, confirming the COPs role in suppressing electrochemical Ostwald ripening.35 To probe potential degradation of Cu COPCOOH composites, quasi-quantitative SEM-EDS mapping tracked the CCu atomic ratio during electrolysis. As shown in Figure S31, the CCu ratio decreased after 90 h, indicating partial detachment of COPCOOH. This detachment correlates with the observed decline in FEEtOH, underscoring the need for strategies such as periodic COP replenishment or covalent anchoring to enhance interfacial adhesion and extend opera- tional stability. While the above-mentioned CO2-to-ethanol metrics are obtained using pure CO2 feedstocks, this limits practical implementation due to the energy-intensive gas purification. Real-world viability requires CO2RR technologies operating under dilute CO2 streams 1020 vv CO2 from industrial point sources such as coal-fired power plants.36 To bridge this gap, we test the CuCOPCOOH composite under simulated flue gas conditions 20 vv CO2.36 Remarkably, it achieves a high FEEtOH of 40.8 at 1.2 VRHE Figure S32, demonstrating its ability to achieve efficient CO2 conversion under dilute CO2 streams.

XXXX, XXX, XXXXXX F switching to a CO2-saturated environment, this peak shifts positively by 82 mV, accompanied by near-complete suppression of the oxidation peak in COPCOOH Supplemen- tary Note 3. This observation implies the participation of carbonyl motifs in CO2 activation, probably acting as electron mediators to facilitate CO2 activation to CO2 as illustrated in the inset of Figure 4a.19,39 To elucidate the real-time interplay between COP functional motifs and CO2RR intermediates, in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy ATR-SEIRAS is employed. As substantiated by the potential- dependent spectra in Figures 4b,c and S34, COPCOOH exhibits distinct vibrational shifts: OH red-shift from 3238 to 2967 cm1 and CO stretches from 1661 to 1610 cm1. These shifts, absent in COPCO and COPOH, could be rationalized by the intriguing interaction with CO2 as elucidated in the inset of Figure 4a, which elongates CO and OH linkages via charge polarization and hydrogen bonding.19,40 Concurrently, the C O signal for COPCOOH attenuates by 48.2 from 0.8 to 1.6 VRHE Figure 4c, implying the progressive reduction during electrolysis. Moreover, a vibration signal at 1430 cm1, corresponding to the one-electron reduction form of CO2 CO2 , is distinguished across all three COPs. Quantitative spectral analysis reveals that the CO2 signal intensity increases progressively from COPOH to COPCO and COPCOOH Figure 4d, suggesting that the dual functional synergy benefits CO2 activation.

After that, we turn to unravel the mechanistic impact of COP functional motifs on steering the CO2RR pathways. We first quantify the CO2 adsorption capacities using isothermal titration calorimetry ITC. As shown in Figure S35, the dual- functional CuCOPCOOH exhibits a 6.44-fold higher CO2 adsorption capacity than Cu NPs, following CuCOPCOOH CuCOPCO CuCOPOH. This trend demonstrates that the CO motifs act as molecular antennas to enrich interfacial CO2, and the COOH synergy further amplifies this process. Then, we monitor the real-time evolution of reaction intermediates over CuCOP composites using operando ATR- SEIRAS across 0.8 to 1.6 VRHE Figure 5ad. As a benchmark, almost no discernible signal is observed on the pristine Cu NPs at 0.8 VRHE, consistent with its HER dominance FEH2 40. As the potentials shift cathodic, vibrational signals associated with CObridge 1850 cm1, CHO 1285 cm1, and COCHO 1580 cm1 emerge.41,42 It is worth noting that CuCOPCO and Cu COPCOOH exhibit earlier CO onset and higher intensity than CuCOPOH, directly linking CO motifs to the accelerated CO2 activation.19 CHO signals are also detected and their intensities follow: Cu NPs CuCOPCO Cu COPCOOH CuCOPOH Figure 5e. The higher CHO intensity on CuCOPOH despite its less favorable CHO formation energy Figure 1c arises from slower CHO consumption lack of COCHO signals, Figure 5d.43 Conversely, CuCOPCOOH exhibits efficient CHO depletion via asymmetric coupling as evidenced by the higher COCHO intensity Figure 5b. This trend becomes even more obvious under higher overpotential 1.2 VRHE, aligning with the well- established viewpoint that CC coupling is typically accelerated at higher overpotentials.44 Furthermore, notable COCHO vibration is detected over the CuCOPCOOH composites across the entire potential range, attesting to the heightened asymmetric CC coupling efficiency.45,46 Considering that the asymmetrical CO and CHO coupling is a more energy-efficient pathway for ethanol electrosynthesis, we preliminarily hypothesize that the ethanol selectivity is governed by the dynamic equilibrium of CHO and CO intermediates. To validate this, we derive the potential- dependent CHOCO ratios from operando ATR-SEIRAS Figure S36. For CuCOPCO and CuCOPOH, the CHO CO ratio increases with the applied cathodic bias, reflecting accelerated CO protonation at higher overpotentials. Cu COPOH achieves a higher CHOCO ratio than that of Cu COPCO, directly linking OH motifs to efficient H delivery for CO protonation. In contrast, the CHOCO ratio on Cu COPCOOH declines with the applied potential, signaling rapid CHO depletion, likely due to the promoted CHOCO coupling. These findings establish that COOH synergy balances CHO and CO flux, thereby creating an ideal microenvironment that prioritizes asymmetric CHO-CO coupling to yield ethanol. To delve into the governing principle giving rise to the enhanced ethanol selectivity, we correlate the FEEtOH with the CHOCO ratio derived from three independent operando ATR-SEIRAS measurements Figures 5ad and S37, Table S5.

Figure 5f reveals a volcano-shaped dependence, with peak FEEtOH achieved within a moderate CHOCO ratio range 0.230.40, demonstrating that balanced CHO and CO coverage maximizes asymmetric CHOCO coupling effi- ciency. To experimentally validate CHOs role, we subject HCHO into the CO2RR system to artificially elevate CHO coverage.47,48 Strikingly, the FEEtOH of CuCOPCOOH is further increased to 59.7 with 0.1 mmol HCHO addition Figure S38, confirming that CHO enrichment drives ethanol formation. These results demonstrate that the CO2 to ethanol selectivity is governed by the dynamic equilibrium between the CO2 to CO conversion mediated by CO motifs and CHO formation accelerated by OH motifs. The synergistic COOH interplay achieves an optimal CHOCO flux, creating an interfacial microenvironment that prioritizes asymmetric CHOCO coupling and preferentially stabilizes the CHCOH intermediate, thereby steering the reaction pathway toward ethanol production. CONCLUSION In summary, we demonstrate that the COOH synergy in the CuCOPCOOH hybrid catalyst unlocks unprecedented efficiency for the electroreduction of CO2 to ethanol. The CO motifs function as a molecular antenna to enrich interfacial CO2 and accelerate its activation, while OH groups facilitate water dissociation to sustain H flux for CO protonation into CHO. This molecular-level synergy dynamically balances CO and CHO coverages, creating an optimal microenvironment for asymmetric CHOCO coupling and preferentially stabilizing the CHCOH intermediate. The CuCOPCOOH composite achieves a remarkable FEEtOH of 54.2 and jEtOH of 121.3 mA cm2 in 0.5 M KHCO3, outperforming state-of-the-art CO2RR electrocatalysts in near-neutral electrolytes. Critically, it retains 40.8 FEEtOH under industrially relevant dilute CO2 feeds 20 vol , showcasing practicality for direct integration with flue gas. By decoupling CO2 activation, proton delivery, and intermediate stabilization through organic motif synergy, this work circumvents the scaling relations that plague conventional CO2RR catalysts. Our findings establish a universal design paradigm for manipulating the CO2RR reaction pathway, offering a roadmap to upgrade waste CO2 streams into carbon-neutral ethanol at scale.

Here we demonstrate the use of hexaﬂuorophosphate PF₆ as an electrolyte additive to overcome this limitation, achieving prolonged operation for over 5,000 hours at 1 A cm2 and 2300 hours at 2 A cm2 using NiFe layered double hydroxide LDH as anode. Together with the experimental ﬁndings, PF₆ can intercalate into LDH interlayers and adsorb onto the electrode surface under an applied electric ﬁeld, blocking Cl and stabilizing Fe to prevent segregation. The constant-potential molecular dynamics simulations further reveal the accumulation of high surface concentrations of PF6 on the electrode surface that can effectively exclude Cl, mitigating corrosion. Our work showcases synchronous interlayer and surface engineering by single non-oxygen anion species to enable Clrejection and marks a crucial step forward in seawater electrolysis. Water electrolysis is pivotal to achieving global net-zero targets by 2050, yet the increasing hydrogen demand strains already scarce freshwater supplies17. As Earths most abundant water source, sea- water offers a promising alternative811. Alkaline seawater electrolysis bypasses energy-intensive desalination and extensive pretreatment, improving process efﬁciency1214. When coupled with coastal or off- shore renewable energy, it further reduces operational costs and facilitates scalable green hydrogen production15,16. Nonetheless, the high Cl concentration 0.5 M promotes electrode corrosion through metal chloridehydroxide pathways Supplementary Note 1, accel- erating anode degradation1720. Moreover, while the oxygen evolution reaction OER is thermodynamically preferred in alkaline media, it is a four-electron process with sluggish kinetics. In contrast, the competing chlorine evolution reaction ClER proceeds via a two- electron pathway with lower kinetic barriers, generating toxic chlorine gas21,22. Although seawater alkalinization shifts the OER potential below that of ClER by 480 mV2326, achieving stable ampere-level current densities j remains a challenge due to increased resistance and per- sistent corrosion. Despite incorporating precious metals, current anodes remain constrained by resource limitations, hindering the integration of cat- alytic activity, selectivity, and Cl tolerance2731. Recently, researches on transition-metal sulﬁdes32, phosphides33, nitrides34, or NiCoFe layered double hydroxides LDHs3540, have shown that in situ for- mation of oxyanion-rich layers e.g., SO₄², PO₄³, NO3 or fabricating chloride-repellent coatings37,38 can repel Cl, enabling efﬁcient and Received: 14 January 2025 Accepted: 22 May 2025 Check for updates 1Center for High Altitude Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China. 2Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China. 3College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, Shandong, China. 4Department of Laboratory MedicineClinical Laboratory Medicine Research Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China. 5Laoshan Laboratory, Qingdao, Shandong, China. 6These authors contributed equally: Xun He, Yongchao Yao. e-mail: twwu77uestc.edu.cn; luofengmingwchscu.edu.cn; tangbsdnu.edu.cn;",

LDHs are particularly attractive due to their layered structures, compositional tunability, and strong OER activity in alkaline media4144, but their resistance to Cl-induced degradation remains inadequate36,37. Strategies include creating phy- sical shielding layers35,45, adding oxyanion species SO₄², PO₄³ that can adsorb onto the anode surface46,47, or forming surface chloride- immobilizing layers AgCl, IrCl48,49 have been proposed to exclude Cl via Coulombic repulsion or the common ion effect. The layered and positively charged nature of LDHs also supports anion intercalation, and numerous studies conﬁrm that intercalated oxyanions can block chloride penetration5053. Extending this concept, some studies have combined surface and interlayer engineering with dual species54,55. The Zou group54 intercalated CO₃² into CoFe LDH and attached graphene quantum dots on the surface, achieving 2800 h of long-term durability at 1.25 A cm2 in simulated seawater. Our group55 further introduced OH-enriching Cr₂O₃ onto NiFe LDH surfaces and Cl-repelling CrO₄² into the interlayers, enabling 1000 h at 1 A cm2 followed by 1500 h at 2 A cm2. Despite these advancements indicating considerable pro- gress, developing simple and effective strategies to sustain prolonged electrolysis 5000 h under high j for anode materials is still a major challenge. In this work, a NiFe LDH anode, operated with hexaﬂuoropho- sphate PF₆ as an electrolyte additive, delivers stable operation for over 5000 h at 1 A cm2 and 2300 h at 2 A cm2. Ex situin situ evidences show that PF₆, driven by the electric ﬁeld, can facilely intercalate into the LDH layers and adsorb onto the surface, facilitating a single-ion- driven surface-interlayer synergy that excludes Cl. This additive also improves the durability of CoFe LDH, enabling continuous operation at 2 A cm2 for 1200 h, thereby rendering CoFe LDHNiFe LDH as top contenders for industrial-level seawater electrolysis. Constant- potential molecular dynamics simulations further verify that surface- accumulated PF₆ efﬁciently excludes Cl. Beyond its durability, the NiFe LDH anode coupled with a PtC cathode also delivers notable performance in an alkaline seawater electrolyzer. Results Enhanced alkaline seawater oxidation ASO performance with PF₆ additive The NiFe LDH nanosheet array, consisting of two-dimensional 2D layers, was fabricated on nickel foam NiFe LDHNF through a one- step hydrothermal approach56. Extensive characterizations via X-ray diffraction XRD, scanning electron microscopy SEM, transmission electron microscopy TEM, high-resolution TEM HRTEM, and high- angle annular dark ﬁeld scanning TEM HAADF-STEM verify the suc- cessful synthesis of NiFe LDHNF with a Ni:Fe atomic ratio of 3:1 Supplementary Figs. 15, Supplementary Table 1.

A standard three-electrode conﬁguration was employed to eval- uate the OER performance of NiFe LDHNF in alkaline seawater, either containing 20 mM PF₆ or without any additive. As shown in the polarization curves Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 6, the presence of PF₆ reduces the overpotentials required to obtain the j of 200, 500, and 1000 mA cm2 209, 247, 282 mV compared to the corresponding values of 282, 315, and 343 mV in PF₆-free seawater. NiFe LDHNF in PF₆-containing seawater also outperforms bare NF, benchmark RuO₂ and IrO₂ catalysts, ranking among the top-tier catalysts reported to date Supplementary Table 2. Turnover frequency TOF analysis inset of Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 7 further shows enhanced intrinsic activity in the presence of PF₆. Electrochemical double-layer capacitance Cdl measurements Supplementary Fig. 8 indicate a higher electrochemically active surface area ECSA with PF₆, in line with its enhanced OER activity. Even after normalizing j to ECSA Supplementary Fig. 9, NiFe LDHNF in PF₆-containing seawater maintains higher activity than in the PF₆-free counterpart. Tafel slope analysis based on polarization curves obtained at a slow scan rate of 1 mV s1 Supplementary Fig. 10, Fig. 1b conﬁrms that PF₆ addition improves the reaction kinetics for NiFe LDHNF, outperforming RuO₂ and IrO₂. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy over the potential range of 1.4051.485 V Supplementary Fig. 11 further reveals that NiFe LDHNF in PF₆-containing seawater exhibits lower charge-transfer resistance than in PF₆-free seawater, supporting accelerated inter- facial electron transfer. To assess corrosion resistance, Tafel scanning was performed Fig. 1c, showing that the corrosion potential of NiFe LDHNF shifts positively in PF₆-containing seawater, indicative of improved corrosion stability. Moreover, Faradaic efﬁciency for oxygen evolution at 1 A cm2 reaches nearly 100 with NiFe LDHNF in PF₆- containing seawater Supplementary Fig. 12, conﬁrming selective four-electron O₂ evolution. At an industrial-level j of 1.0 A cm2, NiFe LDHNF in PF₆-containing seawater operates stably for over 5000 h Fig. 1d, a 41.6-fold improvement in stark contrast to its rapid failure within 120 hours in PF₆-free seawater inset of Fig. 1d. Ultravioletvisible spectroscopy Supplementary Fig. 13 veriﬁes minimal active chlorine generation with PF₆ present, in stark contrast to high chlorine levels in the PF₆-free seawater electrolyte. Even under a higher j of 2.0 A cm2, NiFe LDHNF demonstrates stable operation in PF₆-containing seawater for over 2300 h Fig. 1e. In light of these results, using NiFe LDHNF anode with PF₆ as an electrolyte additive facilitates a notable advance for seawater electrolysis at high j, beyond that of currently explored anionic species Supplementary Table 3, and showing promise for industrial applications. Investigation of activity enhancement and corrosion resistance Operando Raman spectroscopy was performed using a custom- designed electrochemical cell Supplementary Fig. 14a to monitor structural changes for NiFe LDH from open-circuit potential OCP to 1.75 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode RHE.

In PF₆-free sea- water, Raman spectra collected at potentials below 1.35 V show peaks at 454 and 527 cm1, assigned to the A1g stretching modes of NiOH and NiO, respectively Fig. 2a. Upon increasing the applied potential, two additional peaks emerge at 475 and 556 cm1, corresponding to the Eg bending and A1g stretching vibrations of NiO for NiOOH44,5759. Con- currently, the disappearance of the NiOH lattice vibration 300 cm1 and attenuation of signals associated with CO₃²NO₃ species 727 cm1 further support the occurrence of dehydration and oxida- tion processes during OER6062. In PF₆-containing seawater, apart from the progressive blue shifts of NiO bands 454527 to 475556 cm1, an additional Eg vibration of PF₆ is observed at increasing potentials, potentially due to its intercalation into LDH layers. As the applied potential continues to rise, the intensiﬁcation of the A1g vibration indicates extensive PF₆ accumulation on the electrode surface driven by a stronger applied electric ﬁeld Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 14b. To verify electric-ﬁeld-driven intercalation, NiFe LDHNF electrode was held at 1.15 V for 10 min in PF₆-containing seawater. Structural ana- lyses, including XRD, SEM, TEM, HRTEM, and HAADF-STEM Supple- mentary Figs. 1519, collectively conﬁrm the successful incorporation of PF₆ into the NiFe LDH interlayers. Given its large ionic radius, PF₆ displaces native interlayer anions, expanding the interlayer spacing, exposing more active sites, thus promoting OER activity. Raman spectroscopy after intercalation Supplementary Fig. 20 further con- ﬁrms this process, as evidenced by the disappearance of characteristic CO₃²NO₃ peaks and the emergence of a pronounced Eg vibration mode of PF₆. Additionally, we observed a slight blue shift for NiFe LDH Raman peaks following PF₆ intercalation Supplementary Fig. 21, contrary to the usual red shifts induced by cation-driven NiO bond elongation58,63,64. Operando Raman spectroscopy of PF₆-intercalated NiFe LDH in PF₆-free seawater Fig. 2c shows delayed γ-NiOOH for- mation, consistent with the observations in PF₆-containing seawater. With increasing potential, partial deintercalation of PF₆ occurs, accompanied by interlayer contraction due to shortening of NiO bonds. A subsequent chronopotentiometry test at 2 A cm2 shows that PF₆-intercalated NiFe LDHNF maintains stable operation for about Article https:doi.org10.1038s41467-025-60413-0 Nature Communications 2025 16:4998 2 520 h in PF₆-free seawater Supplementary Fig. 22, substantially less than the 2300 h achieved in PF₆-containing seawater. These obser- vations underscore the crucial role of surface-accumulated PF₆ in enhancing resistance to chloride-induced corrosion under prolonged high j conditions.

Conversely, NiO coordination weakens Supplementary Fig. 24, and Ni becomes more reduced, suggesting that PF₆ does not directly remove electrons from Ni but instead facilitates electron transfer from Fe to Ni, which potentially account for the delayed γ-NiOOH formation observed for PF₆-inter- calated NiFe LDH and NiFe LDH in PF₆-containing seawater. Further- more, the slight contraction of the NiO bond upon PF₆ intercalation accounts for the blue shift observed in Raman spectra Supplemen- tary Fig. 21.

Through combined ex situ and in situ analyses, we verify that PF₆ can intercalate into the NiFe LDH interlayers and accumulate on the electrode surface under applied electric ﬁeld Fig. 2h. This dual reg- ulation of interlayer species and surface adsorption by a single non- oxygen anion contributes to Fe stabilization by suppressing segregation, and efﬁciently excludes Cl, enabling durable ampere- level seawater oxidation. Catalytic durability with PF₆ additive: insights from experiment and molecular dynamics Our strategy is also applicable to other LDHs for ASO catalysis, as demonstrated using CoFe LDH as a model.

    "text": "surface chloride immobilization, oxyanion-based electro- static repulsion, or dual-species interlayersurface modiﬁcations Supplementary Table 7, Fig. 3b. To further elucidate the mechanism by which PF₆ enhances corrosion resistance, we employed advanced constant-potential molecular dynamics CPMD simulations to investigate the interac- tions between PF₆ and Cl at the electrolyte-electrode interface under a positive potential of U 1.5 V65. This approach provides an accurate simulation of atomic-scale dynamics at the electrocatalystelectrolyte interface under operational conditions65. The calculation results indi- cate that the introduction of a single PF₆ into the electrolyte has no marked effect on Cl at the electrode surface Fig. 3c, d, because the density distribution of Cl on the electrode surface does not change considerably. Further increasing the number of PF6 to three generates a higher concentration of PF6 on the electrode surface, and we observe that the density of Cl moves substantially away from the electrode surface by about 2 Å Fig. 3e, f. These results support the operando Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical durability results, where the accumulation of PF6 at the catalystelectrolyte interface under high j correlates with enhanced long-term stability. Practical electrolysis applications To evaluate the practical application, we constructed a membrane electrode assembly MEA electrolyzer with an anion exchange mem- brane AEM, PiperION-A60 Fig. 4a. In this conﬁguration, anions and water migrate through the AEM, facilitating electron transfer at the NiFe LDHNF anode and the PtCNF cathode. Concurrently, H₂, O₂, and discharged seawater, are expelled from the electrolyzer chamber. For comparison, a RuO₂NFPtCNF conﬁguration was also tested. The NiFe LDHNFPtCNF electrolyzer employes a dual-feed approach with 6 M KOH seawater served as the catholyte and the anolyte consisted of 6 M KOH seawater with the addition of PF₆. In contrast, the RuO₂NFPtCNF electrolyzer uses 6 M KOH seawater as both the anolyte and catholyte.

Speciﬁcally, the NiFe LDH NFPtCNF electrolyzer requires only 2.02 V to achieve a j of 1.0 A cm2. Furthermore, the energy consumption at the j of 0.2 and 0.5 A cm2 is calculated to be 3.60 and 4.04 kWh m³ H₂, respectively, outperforming conventional electrolyzer that demand 4.47 kWh m³ at 0.2 A cm2. Stability tests were carried out to evaluate the long-term robustness of the electrocatalytic system. The NiFe LDHNFPtCNF electrolyzer operating in 6 M KOH seawater with PF₆ additives maintain stable performance for over 1000 h at a j of 1.0 A cm2 Fig. 4c. In contrast, the same MEA electrolyzer in PF₆-free seawater experiences rapid degradation after only 31 hours Supplementary Fig. 34, further underscoring the critical role of PF₆ in sustaining electrode stability. A preliminary economic analysis Supplementary Note 2 indicates that, under a typical electricity rate of US0.02 kWh1, the hydrogen production cost is approximately US1.07 kg1 H₂ at 1.0 A cm2 and 2.02 V. Additionally, Supplementary Table 8 and Fig. 4d illustrates that the incorporation of PF₆ additives into the NiFe LDH NF anode not only provides a competitive cell voltage at high j but also ensures prolonged electrolysis stability. Speciﬁcally, the MEA electro- lyzer with NiFe LDHNF anode and PF₆ additives exhibit outstanding activity and durability, paving an important step toward practical deployment of seawater electrolysis for hydrogen production. Discussion Our study identiﬁes PF₆ as a crucial electrolyte additive that markedly enhances the durability of NiFe LDH anode, achieving over 5000 h of stable operation at 1 A cm2 and 2300 h at 2 A cm2. Comprehensive ex situin situ studies and CPMD simulations reveal the mechanisms behind this improvement. Firstly, under a low applied electric ﬁeld, PF₆ intercalates into the LDH layers, expanding interlayer spacing and exposing more active sites, thereby boosting ASO activity. Con- currently, PF₆ weakly coordinates with Fe sites, preventing segrega- tion and preserving electrode integrity. Secondly, PF₆ also adsorbs and accumulates on the electrode surfaces under a high applied electric ﬁeld, effectively blocking Cl. In a two-electrode MEA elec- trolyzer, this conﬁguration requires 19.46 less electrical energy than conventional electrolyzer and maintains electrolysis durability for over 1000 h. This study pioneers the efﬁcacy of single-anion engineering in enabling interlayersurface modiﬁcations, providing LDH structures with structural integrity and Cl-repelling capabilities, thereby paving the way for sustainable and large-scale hydrogen production.

Synthesis of NiFe LDHNF NiFe LDH was grown on NF 2 cm 3 cm via a hydrothermal process. An aqueous solution containing 0.7 mmol FeNO₃₃9H₂O, 2.1 mmol NiNO₃₂6H₂O, 4 mmol NH₄F, and 10 mmol urea was transferred to a Teﬂon-lined autoclave along with NF and heated at 120 C for 6 h. After cooling to room temperature, the NiFe LDHNF was rinsed with deio- nized water, dried at 60 C. The loading mass of NiFe LDH is 1.93 mg cm2. Synthesis of PF₆-intercalated NiFe LDHNF NiFe LDHNF electrode was held at 1.15 V for 10 min in PF₆-containing seawater to obtain PF₆-intercalated NiFe LDHNF, with HgHgO and graphite serving as reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The sample was then removed, rinsed with deionized water, dried at 60 C. The resulting material has a loading mass of 2.02 mg cm2. Synthesis of CoFe LDHNF CoFe LDH was prepared on NF 2 cm 3 cm by dissolving 3 mmol CoNO₃₂6H₂O, 1 mmol FeNO₃₃9H₂O, and 3 mmol urea in 30 mL deionized water. This mixture and the nickel foam substrate were placed in a Teﬂon-lined autoclave and heated at 120 C for 6 h. After cooling, the CoFe LDHNF was thoroughly rinsed, dried at 60 C. The loading mass of CoFe LDH is 1.59 mg cm2. Preparation of IrO2NF and RuO2NF The IrO₂NF and RuO₂NF electrodes were prepared following the procedures reported in our previous work without modiﬁcation21. Commercial RuO₂ and IrO₂ powders were loaded onto NF with the same mass loading as that of NiFe LDHNF. Characterizations The crystal phases of the synthesized materials were identiﬁed using X-ray diffraction XRD with a Bruker D8 Advance instrument. Surface and structural morphologies were examined via scanning electron microscopy SEM on a Gemini SEM 300 ZEISS and transmission electron microscopy TEM alongside high-resolution TEM HRTEM using a JEM-F200 JEOL. Elemental and chemical state analyses were carried out using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS on an ESCALABMK II spectrometer equipped with an Mg source.

X-ray absorption ﬁne structure XAFS data were collected at room tem- perature at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline BL11B. The metal content of the catalysts and the extent of Fe leaching in alkaline seawater were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ICP-MS, Agilent 5110. Optical absorbance was assessed with a SHIMADZU UV-1800 spectrophotometer, and detailed surface composition was analyzed using time-of-ﬂight secondary ion mass spectrometry TOF-SIMS on a PHI TRIFT V nano TOF system. Electrochemical tests ASO evaluations were performed at room temperature using a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation, and electrode stability was tested with a LANHE battery tester Wuhan, China under steady current conditions. A typical three-electrode arrangement was implemented, using NiFe LDHNF, CoFe LDHNF, RuO₂NF, IrO₂NF, or NF as the working electrodes. The reference electrode was HgHgO, and a graphite rod served as the counter electrode. The electrolytes used were either 1 M KOH seawater or seawater containing 20 mM PF₆, with a total volume of 50 mL. To reduce magnesium and calcium ion concentrations, natural seawater was treated with sodium carbonate Na₂CO₃, AR prior to use21. To prepare 1 M KOH 20 mM PF₆ sea- water electrolytes, 56.11 g of KOH and 3.69 g of KPF₆ were dissolved in 1 L of treated seawater, stirred, and sonicated. The electrolytes were used within 1 h of preparation, kept at room temperature. The pH was measured to be 13.97 0.11. Electrode potentials were reca- librated against the RHE using the equation: ERHE EHgHgO 0.098 0.059 pH. The HgHgO electrode was calibrated in H₂ using a Pt wire as the working electrode. The iR-compensated potential Ecorr was determined using the relation Ecorr E iR, where E is the Article https:doi.org10.1038s41467-025-60413-0 Nature Communications 2025 16:4998 7 measured potential, i is the applied current, and R is the solution resistance determined at OCP, measured to be 1.544 0.01 Ω. Elec- trochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were per- formed over a frequency range of 10 kHz to 0.01 Hz with a perturbation amplitude of 5 mV. Prior to long-term durability eva- luation, the electrode was subjected to chronopotentiometric acti- vation to facilitate PF₆ intercalation. Throughout the test, alkaline seawater was continuously replenished to counteract electrolyte loss. TOF calculation TOF was determined using the formula TOF Aj4Fm, where A represents the geometric area of the electrode, j is the current density, 4 corresponds to the number of electrons per mole of O₂ produced, and F is the Faradaic constant 96,485 C mol1. The parameter m denotes the active site concentration in moles. To calculate m, the slope of the oxidation peak current versus scan rate was analyzed using the equation Slope n²F²m4RT, with n 1 assumed for a single- electron process. ECSA and ECSA-normalized j The speciﬁc activity was determined by normalizing the j to ECSA. The ECSA was calculated based on the Cdl, measured through CV curves from 1.09 to 1.19 V",

ECSA and ECSA-normalized j The speciﬁc activity was determined by normalizing the j to ECSA. The ECSA was calculated based on the Cdl, measured through CV curves from 1.09 to 1.19 V vs. RHE without iR correction, where no Faradaic current occurs. Cdl was plotted as Δj2 at 1.14 V vs. RHE against scan rates to obtain the slope. ECSA was then derived using the formula ECSA ACdlCs, where Cs is the speciﬁc capacitance 0.04 mFcm255. Operando Raman tests Raman spectra were recorded using a LabRAM HR Evolution confocal Raman spectrometer with a 532 nm laser and a 50 objective lens. Operando experiments were conducted using a custom-designed Raman cell, where NiFe LDH, PF₆-intercalated NiFe LDH or CoFe LDH served as the working electrode. A platinum wire was utilized as the counter electrode, and HgHgO acted as the reference electrode. The electrolyte solution comprised 1 M KOH seawater or PF6 -containing seawater. Voltage-time tests were executed on a CHI 660E electro- chemical workstation at OCP1.75 V vs. RHE step: 0.05 V. Constant potential molecular dynamics calculations Constant potential molecular dynamics CPMD is an effective meth- odology for examining the dynamics of electrochemical interfaces in explicit solvent environments under ﬁxed potential conditions. This approach is well-suited for systems of moderate size, allowing com- prehensive investigation of interfacial properties and electrochemical interactions65. The simulation procedure began by arranging 40 explicit water molecules to create a density of 1 g cm3. Following this, three Cl were placed randomly in the aqueous phase to ensure uni- form distribution. Finally, we achieved the variation of different con- centrations by introducing different numbers of PF6 on the surface of the catalyst. In our CPMD simulations, Langevin dynamics with a fric- tion coefﬁcient of 0.2 was utilized to regulate the system temperature at 300 K66. A simulation timestep of 1 femtosecond fs was adopted, with hydrogen atoms assigned a mass of 2 atomic mass units u. The simulation trajectories were conducted with eigenstate settings of 1.0e4, density settings of 1.0e5, and energy settings of 1e6, ensuring accurate representation of the electrochemical processes. Fabrication of MEA The MEA was constructed using NiFe LDHNF as the anode and PtCNF with a geometric area of 1 cm² as the cathode. An anion exchange membrane 60 μm thickness, 1.2 cm 1.2 cm in size was pre-treated in 1 M KOH for over 12 h to convert it into the hydroxide form, followed by thorough rinsing with deionized water. During operation, alkaline seawater electrolyte was continuously circulated through the cell at a constant ﬂow rate of 50 mL min1, and full-cell performance was eval- uated at 60 C using a GW Instek PSW 80-13.5.

Herein, we develop a single-atom Ir decorated Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 photoanode for selective PEC synthesis of adipic acid from cyclohexanone using water as the oxygen source. The PEC system achieves 6.0 μmol cm2 h1 adipic acid production with 60 Faradaic efﬁ- ciency and 88 selectivity. The single-atom Ir promotes the photogenerated carrier separation and transfer, while regulating the electronic structure of Ti- doped α-Fe2O3 photoanode to optimize its adsorption strength of OH and cyclohexanone. Mechanistic studies reveal a non-free-radical reaction pathway at the atomic level, driven by photogenerated holes through an adsorbed hydroxyl transfer. Notably, integrating the photoanode and an amorphous silicon-based photocathode leads to a bias-free PEC device that enables stable adipic acid production for over 80 hours, underscoring the potential for sus- tainable light-driven synthesis. Selective and energy-efﬁcient synthesis of value-added chemicals is crucial for chemical manufacturing. Photoelectrochemical PEC tech- nique represents a sustainable approach to solar-to-chemical energy conversion13. In addition to its established applications in water splitting and CO2 reduction, PEC technique has also shown immense promise in biomass upgrading4, pharmaceutical intermediate synthesis5, and ﬁne chemicals production6,7. This adaptability can be attributed to its capacity to synergistically integrate photo- and electrochemical pro- cesses, allowing the precise modulation of chemical reactions8,9. For instance, BiVO4 photoanode exhibits remarkable performance in the PEC selective oxidation of biomass-derived glycerol to dihydrox- yacetone, a compound widely used in cosmetic, pharmaceutical and ﬁne chemicals1012. Similarly, Mo-doped WO3 photoanode has been demonstrated to effectively promote PEC decarboxylative tri- ﬂuoromethylation, which is critical for the modiﬁcation of pharmaceu- tical and agrochemical compounds. Notably, this technique facilitates 100-gram-scale synthesis using PEC ﬂow cells, indicating its potential for practical applications5. Despite such advancements, the intricacy of photoelectrode surface structures and radical-dominated mechanisms highlights a notable deﬁciency in comprehending and modulating the reaction process at the atomic level.

These attributes make SACs an ideal model for addressing the aforementioned challenges in PEC systems. Only recently, engineering SACs has been progressively employed to enhance the performance of PEC water splitting16,17. This SACs- engineering approach has proven effective in promoting the separa- tion and transfer of photogenerated carriers, while also reducing the reaction barrier as a speciﬁc water oxidation active site1820. As a result, the photoelectrodes engineered with single-atom sites exhibit ele- vated photocurrent densities and enhanced solar-to-hydrogen STH efﬁciency. Recent studies on PEC alcohols and aldehydes oxidation as alternatives to water oxidation also demonstrate the beneﬁcial effects of single atoms on photogenerated charge kinetics and free radicals generation21,22. Hydroxyl radicals OH are typically regarded as the reactive oxygen species in such systems. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether single-atom sites primarily act as adsorption sites for reactants or as active sites for reactive species generation. Moreover, the mechanisms underlying the synergistic effects of single-atom sites and photoelectrode surfaces during catalysis remains elusive. Herein, we present a PEC strategy for the selective synthesis of adipic acid AA, a crucial raw material for the manufacture of polye- sters, polyamides, lubricants and plasticisers23, on single-atom active sites decorated Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 photoanode. Industrially, AA is produced via catalytic oxidation of the cyclohexanolcyclohexanone mixture KA oil in concentrated nitric acid, which is energy-intensive and gives rise to serious environmental issues such as N2O emission24. To avoid the N2O emission, the catalytic dehydroxylation and hydro- genation approach has been developed for converting glucaric acid to obtain AA2527. However, the ring-opening reaction and the selective oxidation of cyclohexanone or cyclohexanol under mild conditions impose signiﬁcant challenges28,29, especially in an efﬁcient PEC system with sustainable solar energy. To this end, in this work we establish a selective PEC synthesis of AA via cyclohexanone oxidation using a single-atom Ir decorated Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 photoanode, where water serves as the sole oxygen source and light-coupled electrical bias provides the energy input. The incorporation of Ir single atoms not only promotes the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers, but also enhances the adsorption and conversion of cyclo- hexanone. At 1.5 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode vs. RHE, the as-prepared photoanode achieves an AA production rate of 6 µmol cm2 h1 with 60 Faradaic efﬁciency FE and 88 selectivity. Moreover, combined in situ spectroscopy and detailed experiments resolve a non-free-radical reaction mechanism for selective oxidation of cyclohexanone to AA, which is driven by photogenerated holes and synergizes adsorbed hydroxyl OH transfer on the as-prepared pho- toanode surface. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that Ir single atoms strongly adsorb OH and regulate the electronic structure of α- Fe2O3 to promote adsorption",

Theoretical calculations demonstrate that Ir single atoms strongly adsorb OH and regulate the electronic structure of α- Fe2O3 to promote adsorption of cyclohexanone at Fe sites, thereby balancing the competing adsorption of cyclohexanone and OH. Finally, we design and construct an integrated system consisting of the single-atom sites engineered photoanode and an amorphous silicon-based a-Si photocathode. This unassisted SACs-based PEC system demonstrates selective, stable and efﬁcient AA production, illustrating the promise of single-atom catalysis for sustainable chemical manufacturing. Results and discussion Synthesis and characterizations Figure 1a illustrates the synthetic procedure of single-atom Ir deco- rated α-Fe2O3 photoanode see details in Experimental section. To improve the conductivity and photocurrent density of α-Fe2O3 pho- toanode, Ti doping strategy30,31 was adopted in this work, and thus leads to Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 TFO as the model photoanode. Speciﬁ- cally, TFO were grown on ﬂuorine-doped tin oxide FTO glass sub- strates via hydrothermal method followed by annealing in air. Subsequently, electrochemical deposition treatment was carried out to prepare the single-atom Ir decorated TFO sample Ir1TFO. For comparison, IrOx clusters decorated TFO sample IrOxTFO was also prepared via electrochemical deposition. As shown in the X-ray dif- fraction XRD patterns Supplementary Fig. 1, TFO, Ir1TFO and IrOx TFO samples exhibit the hematite phase JCPDS No. 33-0664. Scan- ning electron microscopy SEM and transmission electron micro- scopy TEM images conﬁrm that all samples possess nanorods structure Supplementary Fig. 2ac, Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4ac. From the aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-ﬁeld scanning transmission electron microscopy AC- HAADF-STEM, Fig. 1c image, the observed interplanar distance of 0.27 nm corresponds well to the 104 plane of hematite32, and no Ir- related nanoparticles are found on the surface of Ir1TFO. Similar structures were also observed in the high-resolution TEM HRTEM images of TFO and IrOxTFO Supplementary Figs. 2d, 4d. Further- more, as the contrast of the atomic columns is approximately pro- portional to the square of the atomic number Z33, the bright spots marked with yellow circles are identiﬁed as Ir single atoms, as con- ﬁrmed by the corresponding strength line proﬁles Fig. 1d. Addition- ally, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy EDS elemental mapping also displays the uniform distribution of Ir and Ti elements on Ir1TFO sample Fig. 1e. For IrOxTFO sample, distinct IrOx clusters with a diameter of 12 nm can be observed Supplementary Fig. 4e, f. To investigate the electronic structure and local coordination environment of the above samples, we conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption ﬁne spectroscopy XAFS. The Fe 2p spectra Supplementary Fig. 5a exhibit the spin-orbit coupling splitting, which is a featured characteristic of Fe2O3 sample34. The O 1s spectra can be cleaved into lattice oxygen, oxygen vacancy and hydroxyl peaks Supplementary Fig. 5b35.

It is observed that the incorporation of Ir single atoms has negligible effect on the O 1s orbitals. In contrast, introducing IrOx clusters shifts the lattice oxygen peak to lower binding energy, indicating the presence of substantial IrO interaction. The two peaks observed in the Ti 2p spectra are attributed to the Ti 2p32 and Ti 2p12 orbitals of Ti4, respectively, which corroborates the successful doping of Ti4 in the samples Supple- mentary Fig. 5c. Importantly, the binding energies of Ir 4f72 and Ir 4f52 in Ir1TFO sample are observed at 62.4 and 64.7 eV, respectively, proving the positive oxidation state of Ir single atoms Fig. 2a36. For the IrOxTFO sample, the Ir 4 f spectrum shifts to higher binding energy, suggesting an oxidation state approaching 4. To further reveal the ﬁne structure of Ir species, Ir L3-edge X-ray absorption near- edge structure XANES and extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure EXAFS analyses were carried out. As shown in Fig. 2b, the positions of white line peaks for Ir1TFO and IrOxTFO are close to that of IrO2 standard, suggesting that the oxidation state of Ir species are close to 4 ref. 37. As depicted in Ir L3-edge EXAFS spectra Fig. 2c, both Ir1TFO and IrOxTFO display one prominent peak at about 1.6 Å, which can be attributed to the IrO coordination. EXAFS spectra Fig. 2c, both Ir1TFO and IrOxTFO display one prominent peak at about 1.6 Å, which can be attributed to the IrO coordination. The absence of IrIr 2.6 Å and IrOIr 3.5 Å bonds in the Ir1TFO sample, contrasted with the presence of IrOIr bonds in the IrOxTFO sample, conﬁrms the successful introduction of Ir single atoms and IrOx clusters, respectively. The experimental Ir L3-edge EXAFS spectra were further ﬁtted to give their corresponding local coordination structures Fig. 2d, e, Supplementary Fig. 6a, b and Supplementary Table 1. The ﬁtting results suggest that each Ir single atom is coordinated to ﬁve oxygen atoms in Ir1TFO sample Fig. 2d, which is different from the saturated six coordination state of Ir atoms in IrOxTFO sample Fig. 2e. UVvis diffuse reﬂectance spectra of TFO, Ir1TFO and IrOxTFO samples exhibit similar absorption edge at 605610 nm Supplementary Fig. 7a, indicating that the introduction of Ir species does not alter the light adsorption of TFO samples.

Both Ir1TFO and IrOxTFO samples present upward shift relative to the bare TFO sample.

The bare TFO photoanode displays a photocurrent density of 1.16 mA cm2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE with an onset potential Vonset of 0.94 V. The incorporation of Ir species enhances photocurrent densities of both Ir1TFO and IrOxTFO photoanodes, accompanied by the negative shifts of Von. This indicates that the addition of Ir species, particularly IrOx, facilitates photogenerated carrier transfer and reduces the overpotential of water oxidation. Figure 3b illustrates the enhanced value of the applied bias photo-to-current efﬁciency ABPE for the Ir1TFO and IrOxTFO photoanodes, which are observed to be 0.09 and 0.17, respectively. To evaluate the charge injection efﬁ- ciency ƞinj and charge separation efﬁciency ƞsep, we measured the PEC performance of these samples in the electrolyte with 0.5 M NaSO3 Supplementary Fig. 9ac. The obtained ηinj values at 1.23 V vs. RHE follow the order: IrOxTFO 61.0 Ir1TFO 46.1 TFO 43.4, indicating that Ir species enhance surface holes trapping and facilitate water oxidation Supplementary Fig. 9df. Combined with the theo- retical current density Jabs, both Ir1TFO and IrOxTFO exhibit higher nsep compared to TFO, indicating that efﬁcient holes transport from the bulk to the surface owing to the incorporation of Ir species19. Besides, small discrepancies between steady-state and transient pho- tocurrent density can be achieved on the Ir1TFO and IrOxTFO pho- toanodes Supplementary Fig. 10, implying promoted water oxidation by Ir species and subdued photogenerated carrier recombination38.

Subsequently, normalized open circuit potential OCP decay curves further reveal faster OCP decay for Ir1TFO and IrOxTFO photoanodes Supplementary Fig. 11a, suggesting improved photogenerated car- rier separation and shorter carrier transfer lifetimes τ, as calculated based on the derived-OCP values Supplementary Fig. 11b. The results reveal that the striking built-in electric ﬁeld between the bulk and surface created by Ir species efﬁciently enhances photogenerated carrier separation and transfer kinetics39. Moreover, steady-state photoluminescence PL spectra Supplementary Fig. 12a, time- resolved photoluminescence TRPL spectra Supplementary Fig. 12b and Supplementary Table 2 and photoelectrochemical impedance spectra PEIS, Supplementary Fig. 12c also demonstrate that the Ir species can signiﬁcantly inhibit the photogenerated carrier recombi- nation, while simultaneously promote carrier separation and transfer. PEC cyclohexanone oxidation reaction PEC cyclohexanone oxidation reactions were conducted in a sealed H-type photoelectrochemical cell Supplementary Fig. 13. The addi- tion of cyclohexanone to the electrolyte led to a slight increase in anodic current Supplementary Fig. 14, particularly for the Ir1TFO photoanode, indicating that the thermodynamic constraints of cyclo- hexanone oxidation are more favorable than those of the oxygen evolution reaction OER. Moreover, the LSV results for Ir1TFO pho- toanode in varying cyclohexanone concentrations indicate that mass transfer dominates PEC performance in the low-concentration range 050 mM, Supplementary Fig. 15. The oxidation products were identiﬁed and quantiﬁed using nuclear magnetic resonance NMR spectroscopy. We found that AA was the main oxidation product of cyclohexanone oxidation, with glutaric acid GA as the by-product Supplementary Figs. 1618. Figure 3c shows the production rate and FE of AA from PEC cyclohexanone oxidation over different photo- anodes, and the corresponding I-t curves are displayed in Supple- mentary Fig. 19. The bare TFO photoanode exhibits a relatively low production rate 3.1 μmol cm2 h1 and FE 26.6 for cyclohexanone oxidation to AA. In contrast, the Ir1TFO photoanode achieves the highest AA production rate 6.0 μmol cm2 h1, with an FE of 60 and highest selectivity reaching 88 Fig. 3d. Although the IrOxTFO photoanode generates the highest photocurrent, it exhibits inferior PEC performance in selective cyclohexanone oxidation to AA, with a production rate of 3.9 μmol cm2 h1 and a FE of 44.3.

We further explored the PEC performance of cyclohexanone oxidation over Ir1 TFO photoanode under different applied bias potentials Fig. 3e. Within the range of 1.11.5 V vs. RHE, the production rate of AA increases with rising potential, while the FE of AA remains almost consistent. At 1.7 V vs. RHE, sufﬁcient photogenerated holes drive the selective oxidation of cyclohexanone to AA with a slightly increased production rate. However, at higher potentials, excess photo- generated holes intensify the competing water oxidation leading to a declined FE. Furthermore, the effect of Ir loading Supplementary Table 3 on the production rate and FE of AA was investigated Sup- plementary Fig. 20. The results elucidate that in comparison with the agglomerated Ir species, the atomically-dispersed Ir species promote the selective cyclohexanone conversion, thereby enhancing the pro- duction rate, the selectivity and FE of AA. We also evaluated the per- formance of other cyclic ketones oxidation over Ir1TFO photoanode as shown in Supplementary Fig. 21. The Ir1TFO photoanode demon- strates appropriate versatility by enabling PEC oxidation of cyclic ketones to the corresponding dicarboxylic acids. However, the Ir1TFO photoanode exhibits suboptimal performance in the PEC oxidation of other cyclic ketones in comparison to PEC cyclohexanone oxidation. This discrepancy maybe attributed to the solubility of the substrates in the electrolyte. The Ir1TFO photoanode exhibits a distinctive beneﬁt in selective cyclohexanone oxidation Supplementary Fig. 22. In contrast with the electrocatalytic EC and photocatalytic PC reaction processes, our PEC system exhibits its unique advantages on catalytic performance Supplementary Fig. 23. To achieve the comparable current density, an additional 0.35 V is required to apply on the cell without 100 mW cm2 light illumination. The production rate and FE of AA in electrocatalytic cyclohexanone oxidation are both markedly lower than those in PEC system. These results also demonstrate that the photogenerated carriers",

The production rate and FE of AA in electrocatalytic cyclohexanone oxidation are both markedly lower than those in PEC system. These results also demonstrate that the photogenerated carriers are essential for the PEC cyclohexanone oxi- dation. Additionally, we measured and calculated quantum efﬁciency QE of AA over Ir1TFO photoanode to evaluate the incident photon- to-AA conversion efﬁciency Supplementary Fig. 24. A 14.8 incident photon-to-AA conversion efﬁciency can be achieved at a wavelength of 380 nm. We also evaluated the long-term stability of the photoelectrode, which is critical for determining their suitability towards practical applications. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 25a, the photocurrent density of Ir1TFO could be relatively stable during continuous operation for 24 h. However, this stable photocurrent density does not mean stable AA production. A decline in the FE for AA could be observed Supplementary Fig. 25b, which can be ascribed to a notable reduction in cyclohexanone concentration in the vicinity of the pho- toanode surface. Accordingly, we performed continuous cycling tests on Ir1TFO photoanode with supplying sufﬁcient cyclohexanone for each cycle Fig. 3f. Under the circumstances the photocurrent density together with the AA production of the Ir1TFO photoanode maintain stable over 10 cycles for more than 50 h. This system exhibits con- sistent photocurrent density and achieves high FEs of 57.7 3.6 for AA production, which indicates the good stability of Ir1TFO for PEC cyclohexanone oxidation. Additionally, cyclohexanol can be directly converted to cyclohexanone and AA in the PEC system Supplemen- tary Fig. 26. Then, when using commercial KA oil as the reactant, the Ir1TFO photoanode could produce AA at a production rate of 2.65 μmol cm2 h1 Supplementary Fig. 27, demonstrating its poten- tial for practical applications. Insight into reaction mechanism To identify the oxygen source in AA production, we conducted isotope- labeling experiments using 1 M KOH containing 10 H2 18O as the elec- trolyte Supplementary Fig. 28. The liquid chromatography mass spectrometry LC-MS results display that 18O can be detected in AA production in the form of C6H9O3 18O, C6H9O2 18O2 and C6H9O18O3 Supplementary Fig. 28b, indicating that H2O serves as the oxygen source for the PEC cyclohexanone oxidation to produce AA. As abovementioned, we have investigated the beneﬁcial role of Ir single atoms in promoting photogenerated carrier separation and transfer. To ascertain the role of Ir single atoms in the speciﬁc cyclohexanone oxidation reaction, we ﬁrstly evaluated the adsorption behavior of cyclohexanone. The OCP was monitored at the photoanodes before and after the addition of cyclohexanone into the electrolyte Supple- mentary Fig. 29, which could reﬂect the variation of absorbates in the Helmholtz layer42. When injecting cyclohexanone, a signiﬁcant decrease in the OCP of Ir1TFO photoanode is observed, indicating pronounced adsorption, while the IrOxTFO and TFO photoanodes exhibit weaker adsorption43.

When injecting cyclohexanone, a signiﬁcant decrease in the OCP of Ir1TFO photoanode is observed, indicating pronounced adsorption, while the IrOxTFO and TFO photoanodes exhibit weaker adsorption43. To shield the active surfaces and catalytic sites, Al2O3 passivated layer was coated on Ir1TFO photoanode via chemical bath deposition44. Both Al2O3-coated Ir1TFO surface deno- ted as Al2O3Ir1TFO and Ir single atoms decorated Al2O3-coated TFO surface denoted as Ir1Al2O3TFO exhibit a sharp decrease in AA production Supplementary Fig. 30. This implies that the Ir1-Fe2O3 interface plays a pivotal role in the effective production of AA. We conducted in situ Raman spectroscopy to investigate the dynamic evolution of Ir1TFO photoanode Fig. 4a, b. Without cyclohexanone, a new band at 660 cm1 is observed, corresponding to the disorder in the Fe2O3 crystal lattice when the applied potential increases to 1.0 V vs. RHE45. This may be due to the Fe-OOH species obtained through cou- pling of OH and photogenerated holes by FeIVO species46, where the FeIVO species are attributed to the evolution of photogenerated holes trapped by the surface states of α-Fe2O3 6. The formation of Fe-OOH species is believed to result from the sustained formation of OH on the Fe2O3 surface during water oxidation47,48. Distinctly, after the addition of cyclohexanone, the characteristic band of Fe-OOH species appears only at higher potentials over 1.3 V vs. RHE with lower signal intensity. These ﬁndings demonstrate that the adsorption and conversion of cyclohexanone directly competes with the water oxidation, which leads to Fe-OOH species formation. Efﬁcient cyclohexanone oxidation can suppress the formation of Fe-OOH species. Furthermore, we employed in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy FTIR to probe the reaction species on the photoanodes. Before the addition of cyclo- hexanone, in situ FTIR was carried out to explore H2O activation on the photoanodes. For Ir1TFO Fig. 4c, the OH stretching mode 3643 cm1 of adsorbed water molecules H2O displays an obvious blue-shift with increasing applied potential 1.01.4 V vs. RHE, implying that H2O is converted to OH49. In contrast, TFO exhibits negligible shift with the increasing applied potential Supplementary Fig. 31a. The ν OH band signal of IrOxTFO reaches saturation at 0.8 V vs. RHE, accompanied by a slight red-shift due to rapid conversion of OH Supplementary Fig. 31b50. Upon cyclohexanone addition, the char- acteristic signals of cyclohexanone consumption 1188, 1234, 1280, 1309, and 1600 cm1 and AA formation 1143 and 1498 cm1 were also detected by in situ FTIR Fig. 4d23, indicating the selective conversion of cyclohexanone to AA. Correspondingly, we carried out the control reactions to explore the reaction path of cyclohexanone to AA. Several possible intermediates were added into the PEC reaction as reported in the available literature51,52. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 32, the results show that 2-hydroxycyclohexanone is an important inter- mediate for the selective cyclohexanone conversion to AA. Upon identiﬁcation of the reaction intermediates, we conducted in situ electron paramagnetic resonance EPR spectroscopy to detect the free radicals in cyclohexanone oxidation where 5, 5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N- oxide DMPO served as the trapping",

Upon identiﬁcation of the reaction intermediates, we conducted in situ electron paramagnetic resonance EPR spectroscopy to detect the free radicals in cyclohexanone oxidation where 5, 5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N- oxide DMPO served as the trapping agent Fig. 4e. Using Ir1TFO as the photoanode, no signal was detected without applied potential in dark. In the absence of cyclohexanone in the PEC system, only hydroxyl radical OH signals were detected, suggesting that the photo- generated holes produced by Ir1TFO are able to efﬁciently oxidize OH Article https:doi.org10.1038s41467-025-60506-w Nature Communications 2025 16:5128 5 to OH. The addition of cyclohexanone signiﬁcantly reduces the OH signal intensity, indicating that OH formation is strongly inhibited. Notably, no carbon-centered radicals were detected in PEC cyclohex- anone oxidation process. To further conﬁrm the contribution of dif- ferent active species to the PEC cyclohexanone oxidation, Na2SO3, tert- butanol TBA and NaIO3 were added individually as photogenerated holes, OH and photogenerated electrons scavengers, respectively Supplementary Fig. 33. The addition of Na2SO3 reduces AA produc- tion distinctly, while TBA has minimal effect, demonstrating that the PEC cyclohexanone oxidation process follows a photogenerated holes- induced oxidative mechanism involving OH transfer, rather than the typical PEC organics oxidation induced by OH radicals as reactive oxygen species53,54. To further elucidate the role of Ir single atoms in this selective catalysis reaction, we carried out density functional theory DFT cal- culations. The structural models of bare TFO and Ir1TFO are presented in Supplementary Fig. 34. To account for the existence of competitive adsorption of OH and cyclohexanone, we calculated the adsorption energies of OH and cyclohexanone on the surfaces of TFO and Ir1TFO photoanodes, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5a, the adsorption strength of Fe site for OH 2.61 eV is remarkably stronger than that of cyclohexanone 0.23 eV. With the introduction of single-atom Ir, the adsorption strength of Fe site for OH and cyclohexanone is enhanced to 2.73 and 1.11 eV, respectively. The discrepancy in the adsorption strength of Fe site for OH and cyclohexanone on the Ir1 TFO surface is reduced compared to that without cyclohexanone, whereas a considerable divergence remains on the Ir single-atom site Fig. 5a. Brieﬂy, OH species prefer to bind with Ir single-atom site on the Ir1TFO photoanode, and the presence of Ir single atom balances the competing adsorption of Fe site for OH and cyclohexanone55. Charge density differences analysis demonstrates strong polarization between Ir single-atom site and OH Fig. 5b, c, thus facilitating the trapping and transfer of photogenerated holes. Partial density of states PDOS calculations of TFO and Ir1TFO Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 35 indicate that the d-band center of Fe sites in Ir1TFO is closer to the Fermi energy level than that of TFO, suggesting that Fe sites in Ir1 TFO feature more anti-bonding states, which enables robust d-p orbital interaction between Fe sites and cyclohexanone23.

This intermediate is further converted to a 2-hydroxycyclohexane intermediate via OH transfer, which in turn further formed a 2-hydroxycyclohexane intermediate. OH subsequently attacks the CαH of 2-hydro- xycyclohexane, generating a lactone intermediate, which is hydrolyzed to produce AA56. Device design for unassisted AA production Achieving bias-free monolithic system represents a signiﬁcant objec- tive in the advancement of PEC techniques. Herein, through integra- tion of Ir1TFO photoanode and self-designed a-Si photocathode see detail in Experimental section and Supplementary Figs. 36, 37, we have developed a monolithic PEC system for unassisted light-driven AA production. The operating point corresponds to a potential of 1.6 V vs. RHE Fig. 6a, enabling simultaneous anodic cyclohexanone oxi- dation and cathodic water reduction in the system, wherein the light ﬁrst traverses the unassisted AA production. The overlapped LSV curves of Ir1TFO photoanode with cyclohexanone oxidation and typical hydrogen evolution reaction on a-Si photocathode demonstrate that the device operates effectively at a shared energy level57. Figure 6b and Supplementary Fig. 38 provide comprehensive illustration of this unbiased PEC system. Ultimately, the PEC device for unbiased AA production can be operated stably for at least 16 cycles over 80 h, maintaining the FE of AA at 51.0 7.6 Fig. 6c. Discussion In summary, we have developed a PEC technique for the selective ring- cleaving oxidation of cyclohexanone to adipic acid AA under mild conditions. The Ir1TFO photoanode achieved an AA production rate of 6.0 μmol cm2 h1 with 60 FE and 88 selectivity using H2O as an oxygen source, greatly outperforming conventional TFO photoanode.

LSV experiments were performed by sweeping the potential in the positive direction at a scan rate of 20 mV s1. Transient photocurrent curves were tested with alternating light onoff irradiation each 10 s. Photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy PEIS measurements were taken by applying an AC voltage amplitude of 5 mV at 1.2 V vs. RHE within the frequency range from 105 to 101 Hz under light irradiation.

However, the synthesis of single-crystal TMP, which is essential for elucidating intrinsic properties, remains challenging owing to the lack of eﬃcient methods, low yields, and lengthy processes. This study presents the synthesis of facet-controlled molybdenum phosphide MoP single crystals using a liquid-metal-assisted chemical vapor deposition method. By adjusting the synthesis temperature, two distinct MoP morphologies are created: nanoplates dominated by 0001 facets and pillars dominated by 1010 facets. Electrochemical evaluation reveals that the MoP pillars outperform nanoplates in the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction, achieving over 92 selectivity for H2O2 production and signiﬁcantly higher kinetic current density. Long-term stability tests conﬁrm that the MoP pillars maintain a high Faradaic eﬃciency 90 and stable electrosynthesis over 80 h of continuous operation, highlighting their robustness. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the 1010 facets of the pillars enhance catalytic activity by reducing the OOH adsorption strength, thereby lowering the overpotential. This study underscores the importance of facet engineering in optimizing catalytic performance and provides a pathway for designing advanced TMP-based materials for energy and environmental applications.

Introduction Transition metal phosphides TMPs have garnered considerable attention owing to their novel properties, which make them highly versatile for use in various con- texts such as batteries,1 low-dissipation interconnects,25 and catalysts.68 Within the TMP family, molybdenum phos- phide MoP stands out for its exotic properties, including high thermal and electrical conductivity,911 as well as its role as an eﬃcient and cost-eﬀective cat- alyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction, which involves a two-electron transfer process.1214 MoP also demonstrates ex- cellent catalytic activity and stability in various electrolytic environments. These distinctive characteristics position MoP as a promising material for advanced technologies, particularly in energy-related catalysis and high-performance electronics.

However, synthesizing high-quality MoP single crystals remains challenging owing to the limitations of conven- tional methods. Traditional approaches for MoP synthesis, such as ion-mediated synthesis15,16 and the solgel method,17,18 predominantly yield polycrystalline structures. Meanwhile, other techniques, such as chemical vapor transport CVT and chemical vapor deposition CVD, are hindered by slow growth rates and limited yields, rendering them impractical for broader applications. Although CVT has successfully produced MoP single crystals, its ineﬃciency highlights the need for innovative synthesis methods to enhance yield, eﬃciency, and crystallographic facet control. Recently, liquid-metal-assisted synthesis has emerged as a promising alternative owing to the exceptional physical and chemical properties of liquid metals,19,20 which oﬀer notable op- portunities for catalysis.21 This method enables the synthesis of high-entropy alloys, two-dimensional materials, and single crys- tals, leveraging the low melting points, high surface tension, and self-limiting oxide layer formation ability of liquid metals.2224 Consequently, this method demonstrates promise for improving single-crystal growth, aﬀording notable improvements in yield and growth rate. In this study, we present a method for synthesizing high- quality MoP single crystals using CVD with liquid Ga as the growth substrate. Driven by its high surface energy, Mo from Mo foil diﬀuses toward the Ga surface, engaging in a controlled reac- tion with phosphorus to form MoP single crystals. This approach achieves eﬃcient single-crystal growth while allowing the mod- ulation of crystallographic facets for speciﬁc applications. For in- stance, MoP nanoplates with dominant 0001 surfaces are syn- thesized at high temperatures, while MoP pillars with exposed 1010 surfaces are obtained at lower temperatures. Building upon these advancements, we investigate the po- tential of the synthesized high-quality MoP single crystals as the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction 2eORR catalysts for hydrogen peroxide H2O2 electrosynthesis. Although noble metal catalysts e.g., Pt, Pd, Au-Hg alloys have shown high cat- alytic activity for 2eORR, their high cost limits scalability.2527 In contrast, TMPs are emerging as promising electrocatalysts for 2eORR due to their stable structures and excellent cat- alytic performance.28 Despite numerous reports on MoP for the hydrogen evolution reaction HER,12,29 its catalytic poten- M.-J.

MoP shows strong potential for 2eORR because the Mophosphorus bond- ing at the surface can readily promote electron donation to oxy- gen molecules, thereby enhancing ORR activity compared to its oxide counterparts. Furthermore, the low electrical resistance and excellent oxidation resistance of MoP2 make them highly promising for achieving both high activity and long-term stabil- ity. Consequently, we demonstrate stable H2O2 electrosynthesis over 80 h, outperforming other types of TMP electrocatalyst.28 Using experimental characterization and density functional the- ory DFT predictions, we elucidate the eﬀects of diﬀerent crys- tallographic facets on the catalytic eﬃciency of MoP for selective H2O2 generation. H2O2 has a substantial global market driven by its essential role in water treatment, pulp and paper bleaching, and elec- tronics manufacturing. However, current industrial production methods, particularly the anthraquinone process, face signif- icant challenges such as high energy consumption, environ- mental pollution, and complex logistics.30 This study repre- sents the ﬁrst investigation of high-quality MoP single crys- tals with distinct crystal facets as potential two-electron 2e ORR catalysts, a promising route for renewable and on-site H2O2 generation as an alternative to the anthraquinone pro- cess. By presenting an eﬃcient method for synthesizing high- quality TMP single crystals and clarifying their applications, our research advances material synthesis and catalysis for H2O2 electrosynthesis. 2. Results 2.1. Synthesis of Facet-Controlled MoP Crystals High-quality MoP single crystals were synthesized using a liquid- metal-assisted CVD method Figure 1a. A piece of Mo foil served as both the support for the Ga substrate and the Mo source, while red phosphorus acted as the phosphorus source Figure 1bi. At high growth temperatures, Mo diﬀuses toward the liquid- metal Ga surface, driven by its high surface energy, as depicted in Figure 1bii.19 Speciﬁcally, the low solubility of Mo in Ga promotes eﬃcient extraction from the metal substrate.31 Mo then reacts with phosphorus on the Ga surface, forming MoP nuclei Figure 1biii. Controlling the growth of speciﬁc planes is essential for tailoring the structural and functional charac- teristics of MoP for various applications. At high temperatures, MoP nanoplates with 0001 surfaces are synthesized, whereas at lower temperatures, MoP pillars with 1010 surfaces are formed Figure 1biv. To control the dominant crystallographic plane of MoP crys- tals, the calculated surface energies of various planes were ex- amined to theoretically understand the morphologies of the MoP single crystals. Our DFT calculations reveal that under phosphorus-rich conditions, the P-terminated 0001 surface exhibits the lowest surface free energy, making it the most thermodynamically stable orientation Figure S1, Supporting Information.32 Consequently, nucleation is expected",

At high temperatures, MoP nanoplates with 0001 surfaces are formed, illustrated from both top and side views. At low temperatures, MoP pillars with 1010 surfaces are produced, also illustrated from top and side views. Teal and pink spheres represent Mo and phosphorus atoms, respectively. this, we assessed the relationship between growth temperature and crystal morphology. Notably, at higher temperatures 900 C, increased atomic mobility enables lateral diﬀusion, facilitating the expansion of 0001 facets and leading to nanoplate forma- tion. DFT calculations of Mo adatom diﬀusion on 0001 reveal a diﬀusion energy barrier of 2.1 eV, which is readily overcome at higher temperatures due to enhanced surface diﬀusion Figure S2, Supporting Information. These structures are observed in SEM images Figure 2a and further characterized by transmis- sion electron microscopy TEM. TEM analysis of nanoplate-type MoP single crystals revealed a vertical axis oriented along the 1010 plane Figure 2b. High-resolution TEM imaging showed distinct lattice spacings of 0.28 nm, consistent with the 1010 planes.

The surface facets of the 0001 plane were veriﬁed by electron backscatter diﬀraction EBSD results Figure 2c. As the temperature decreases, limited atomic mobility inhibits lateral diﬀusion, restricting growth along the 0001 plane and instead promoting vertical stacking along 0001, resulting in a 1010 surface morphology that resembles a pillar structure, referred to as MoP pillars. At lower temperatures 700 C, the reduced thermal energy prevents Mo adatoms from overcom- ing the 2.1 eV diﬀusion barrier, leading to their accumulation on 0001 rather than diﬀusing laterally. This results in prefer- ential growth along 0001, ultimately exposing the 1010 sur- face and forming the pillar morphology. This pillar-like struc- ture is observed in the",

Facet-Dependent Electrochemical Catalysis To assess the eﬀects of the crystallographic planes of the syn- thesized MoP crystals on their electrochemical performance, we performed ORR analysis of the MoP pillars and nanoplates in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH using a rotating ring-disk electrode RRDE. Figure 3a illustrates the corresponding linear sweep voltammetry LSV polarization curves. Here, the solid lines rep- resent oxygen reduction currents measured at the disk electrode, indicating the eﬃciency of the ORR process. Meanwhile, the dashed lines correspond to H2O2 oxidation currents measured at the ring electrode, reﬂecting the extent of H2O2 formation. The LSV polarization curves indicate that the MoP pillars pro- duced 2.6 times greater H2O2 currents 1.28 mA cm2 at 0.45 V versus RHE than the MoP nanoplates 0.49 mA cm2 at 0.45 V versus RHE. To further assess their performance, the kinetic cur- rent density for H2O2 production was calculated by correcting for mass transport limitations using the KouteckyLevich equa- tion see Experimental Section.

Moreover, the MoP pillars exhibited a lower ORR overpotential, with an onset potential of 0.68 V versus RHE, compared to 0.61 V versus RHE for the MoP nanoplates. Hence, as illustrated in Figure 3c, the MoP pillars demonstrated signiﬁcantly higher 2eORR mass activity than the MoP nanoplates across the potential range of 0.050.55 V versus RHE. These ORR results indicate that the MoP pillars selectively generate H2O2 via the 2eORR path- way, achieving over 92 H2O2 selectivity at 0.45 V versus RHE Figure 3d. These observations also reveal that the 1010 surface exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance than the 0001 surface. The selective exposure of 1010 planes in the MoP pillars optimizes the binding strength of OOH intermediates, lowering the overpotential, enhancing 2eORR kinetics, and achieving a higher current density compared to MoP nanoplates. The diﬀer- ence in the catalytic performance of the pillars and nanoplates emphasizes the importance of controlling exposed crystal facets for designing eﬃcient ORR electrocatalysts. To conﬁrm that the MoP retains its structural features after electrode coating, we per- formed SEM measurements for the MoP nanoplates, and pillars collected from the electrode surface Figure S6, Supporting In- formation. The SEM images conﬁrmed that their morphologies were preserved, in agreement with the pristine structure shown in Figure 2a,d. The turnover frequency TOF of the MoP pillars was deter- mined to be 0.04 s1, 2.5 times that of the MoP nanoplates 0.016 s1 Figure 3e. This enhanced TOF reﬂects improved 2e ORR kinetics, resulting in sustained and eﬃcient H2O2 produc- tion. To further analyze reaction kinetics, Tafel slope measure- ments were conducted. The results revealed that the MoP pil- lars exhibited a smaller Tafel slope of 84.4 mV dec1 compared to the MoP nanoplates 123.5 mV dec1, indicating faster 2e ORR kinetics Figure 3f. The electrochemically active surface area ECSA of the catalysts was determined using the double- layer capacitance Cdl method derived from cyclic voltamme- try CV curves Figure S7, Supporting Information.39 The obtained Cdl values were 9.52 μF cm2 for the MoP pillars and 7.04 μF cm2 for the MoP nanoplates. ECSA-normalized LSV curves revealed that the MoP pillars exhibited 1.8 times higher ORR current density compared to the MoP nanoplates at 0.45 V versus RHE, indicating their enhanced intrinsic catalytic activity. To evaluate the advantages of single crystal MoP versus polycrystalline MoP, we synthesized polycrystalline MoP as a reference material see the method on Note S1, Supporting Information.2,40 XRD analysis revealed that the polycrystalline MoP comprises multiple crystal planes, including 0001, 1010, 1011 and 2110 planes Figure S8, Supporting Information. LSV polarization curves Figure S9, Supporting Information re- vealed that the polycrystalline MoP exhibited a H2O2 current den- sity of 0.61 mA cm2 at 0.45 V versus RHE, which is slightly higher than that of the MoP nanoplates but considerably lower than that of the MoP pillars Figure S9, Supporting Information.

Considering their ECSA values MoP nanoplates: 7.04 μFcm2, MoP polycrystalline: 14.2 μF cm2, the ECSA-normalized ORR activity of the polycrystalline MoP was even lower than that of the MoP nanoplates Figure S10, Supporting Information. These results support the superior catalytic performance of single crystal MoP, which beneﬁts from controlled facets and enhanced electrical conductivity compared to polycrystalline MoP.2 2.3. Continuous H2O2 Electrosynthesis Electrochemical tests were performed in a three-electrode setup within a divided H-type cell to evaluate the potential of the MoP pillar catalysts for continuous H2O2 electrosynthesis, using O2- or Ar-saturated 0.1 M KOH as the electrolyte. The MoP pil- lar catalysts were coated onto carbon paper at a loading rate of 0.1 mg cm2. A Naﬁon membrane was used to isolate the work- ing electrode WE from the counter electrode CE, preventing H2O2 decomposition at the CE. LSV curves revealed that the MoP pillars exhibit negligible currents in the Ar-saturated elec- trolyte dashed line in Figure 4a. Conversely, signiﬁcant current responses under O2-saturated conditions conﬁrmed the occur- rence of the ORR solid line in Figure 4a. Next, Faradaic eﬃciency FE and H2O2 yield rate were deter- mined by quantifying the amount of accumulated H2O2 in the cathode chamber during the ORR process, using a colorimet- ric method involving a reaction with a TiOSO4 solution see Ex- perimental Section. After 1 h of operation, an electrolyte sam- ple was extracted and reacted with a 0.1 M TiOSO4 solution to quantify H2O2 production across the potential range of 0.10.5 V Figure S12, Supporting Information. As depicted in Figure 4b, the H2O2 yield rate over the MoP pillars steadily increased with the overpotential, peaking at 359.97 mmol g1 h1 at 0.1 V ver- sus RHE. The FE of the 2eORR on the MoP pillars remained consistently above 90 across all tested potentials. We also measured the concentration of accumulated H2O2 generated by the MoP pillars over 10 h at 0.1 V versus RHE. The H2O2 concentration reached 7.6 mM after 10 h, while the FE re- mained steadily above 90 Figure 4c. To evaluate the long-term stability of the MoP pillars, chronoamperometry was performed at a constant potential of 0.1 V versus RHE. The current density remained stable at 3.5 mA cm2 over 80 h Figure 4d. This enhanced stability can be attributed to the robust structural in- tegrity of the MoP single crystals and their resistance to phos- phide oxidation under ORR conditions. These results strongly support the potential of MoP single crystals as practical and scal- able electrocatalysts for sustainable H2O2 production. 2.4.

While local reconstruction, which could expose metallic atoms in phosphides,28,41 cannot be completely ruled out, our results indicate that P-terminated conﬁgurations remain energetically preferred. Thus, under the synthesis conditions in this study, phosphorus atoms are likely to serve as the primary adsorption sites, whereas less-exposed Mo atoms play a more limited role in catalysis. These ﬁndings are consistent with earlier reports suggesting that phosphide sur- faces can expose P atoms depending on speciﬁc experimental parameters.4244 Consequently, based on both XRD data and DFT surface free energy calculations, we modeled the nanoplate morphology with a phosphorus-terminated 0001 surface and the pillar morphology with a phosphorus-terminated 1010 surface Figure 5a,b. Adsorption sites on each surface were classiﬁed as P_Top, PP_Bridge, and PPP_Hollow, based on their atomic conﬁgu- rations. For instance, the site directly above a phosphorus atom was designated as P_Top, the site between two phosphorus atoms was labeled as PP_Bridge, and the hollow site formed by three phosphorus atoms was called PPP_Hollow Figure S14, Supporting Information.

Each site was evaluated for its inter- action with adsorbates relevant to the H2O2 production pathway and the competing ORR.4547 Adsorption calculations revealed that all adsorbates exhibited the strongest binding aﬃnity for the P_Top site Figure S15, Supporting Information. Gibbs free energy calculations were then performed for H2O2 production and the ORR to determine the required overpotentials, with the corresponding results illustrated in Figure 5c,d. The overpoten- tials for H2O2 production were determined to be 1.26 V for the 0001 surface and 1.00 V for the 1010 surface, indicating that the 1010 surface is more favorable for H2O2 production. This aligns with the experimental results, demonstrating improved H2O2 production eﬃciency of the MoP pillars with dominant 1010 surfaces. Additionally, the overpotential for the 4eORR on the 1010 surface was found to be 1.43 V, signiﬁcantly higher than that for H2O2 production. This suggests strong selectivity for the 2eH2O2 generation pathway on the 1010 surface. As depicted in Figure 5c,d, OOH adsorption is a crucial step in determining the overpotential for H2O2 production. No- tably, the 1010 surface exhibited weaker OOH adsorption com- pared to the 0001 surface. To compare the OOH adsorption strength between the nanoplate and pillar morphologies, crys- tal orbital Hamilton population COHP calculations were per- formed Figure 5e.48 Our COHP analysis focused on the in- teraction between the phosphorus atom, the active site on the MoP surface, and the oxygen atom of the OOH molecule. The COHP results revealed a less negative integrated COHP value for the 1010 surface 1.753 eV compared to that for the 0001 surface 2.019 eV, indicating weaker adsorption on the pil- lar structure. This reduced adsorption strength lowers the over- potential, favoring H2O2 production on the 1010 surface. Ad- ditionally, projected density of states PDOS calculations was conducted to further analyze the binding strength, supporting the COHP ﬁndings Figure S16, Supporting Information. This Adv.

PDOS analysis also focused on the surface phosphorus atom and the oxygen atom of OOH Figure 5f,g. Overlapping regions in the PDOS, highlighted in green, represent shared electron den- sity between the atoms. The center of the overlapping band is located at 5.286 eV for the MoP nanoplate and 5.758 eV for the MoP pillar. The deeper band center for the 1010 surface indicates weaker binding interactions, correlating with its lower overpotential. Our DFT calculations reveal that the superior H2O2 produc- tion performance of the MoP pillar morphology stems from its predominantly exposed 1010 surface, which exhibits weaker OOH adsorption strength closer to the optimal value. This re- duced adsorption strength results in a lower overpotential com- pared to that for the 0001 surface of the nanoplate These ﬁndings corroborate the experimental observations and provide atomic-scale insights into the structureperformance relation- ship of MoP catalysts. These insights are expected to be instru- mental in designing advanced electrocatalysts for eﬃcient H2O2 production. 3. Conclusion In summary, this study demonstrated the growth of high-quality, facet-controlled MoP single crystals using a liquid-metal-assisted CVD process. By systematically varying the synthesis tempera- ture, we achieved control over crystal morphologies through re- action rate modulation on the surface, resulting in two distinct structures: MoP nanoplates dominated by 0001 facets and MoP pillars with exposed 1010 facets. Electrochemical evaluations of the MoP nanoplates and pillars revealed the notable inﬂu- ence of crystal facets on the selectivity and activity of the cat- alysts. For instance, the MoP pillars, characterized by exposed 1010 facets, demonstrated superior selectivity and activity for the 2eORR pathway, achieving over 92 H2O2 selectivity and Adv.

The lower overpotential and en- hanced TOF of the MoP pillars corresponded to their optimal binding strength for OOH intermediates, facilitating a more eﬃcient reaction mechanism, as corroborated by DFT calcula- tions. Moreover, long-term stability tests conﬁrmed the robust- ness of the MoP pillars, which maintained a high FE 90 and a stable current density over 80 h of continuous operation, underscoring their potential for continuous H2O2 electrosynthe- sis. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the struc- tureperformance relationships of MoP catalysts, emphasizing the critical role of crystallographic facet control in optimizing cat- alytic performance.

Experimental Section CVD Growth of MoP Single Crystals on Liquid Ga: A commer- cial Ga pellet Alfa Aesar, 99.9 purity was divided into small Ga droplets. Mo foil Alfa Aesar, 99.95 wt. purity was rinsed with ethanol. A Ga droplet was placed on the Mo foil 1 cm 1 cm to form the GaMo substrate, which was then heated in a quartz tube diameter: 1 in to 700 C900 C at a rate of 30 C min1. Red phosphorus powder Alfa Aesar, 99.9 purity was then in- troduced into the tube furnace, and the temperature was maintained at 500 C. MoP growth proceeded over 30 min under Ar 250 sccm and H2 50 sccm ﬂow. Finally, the substrates with grown MoP samples were rapidly cooled to room temperature. Characterizations: The obtained samples were examined using SEM ZEISS Merlin Compact SEM and XPS Thermo Scientiﬁc, ESCALAB 250Xi, monochromatic Al K𝛼radiation. Elemental mapping was per- formed using EDS. Raman spectra were acquired at room temperature us- ing a Raman spectrometer XperRAM S, Nanobase with a 532 nm laser, a beam diameter of 1 μm, and 40 magniﬁcation. Raman spectra were recorded using gratings with 1800 grooves mm1, and the Raman peak of Si at 521 cm1 was used as the reference for wavenumber calibration. XRD measurements were performed using an X-ray diﬀractometer D8 FOCUS; Bruker. Absorbance spectra were recorded at room temperature with a JASCO V-770 spectrophotometer using an 808 nm laser. The EBSD im- age was acquired using an environmental scanning electron microscope Quattro S, Thermo Fisher equipped with EDAX Velocity EBSD camera. Electrochemical Characterization: Measurements of electrochemical H2O2 production were conducted using a conventional three-electrode cell with an RRDE setup and an Autolab potentiostat PGSTAT302N. A platinum sheet Autolab served as the CE, while an AgAgCl electrode functioned as the reference electrode. The RRDE WE consisted of a glassy carbon disk 0.196 cm2 area and a platinum ring. Before measurement, the WE was mechanically polished with alumina powder and rinsed with deionized DI water. A catalyst slurry was prepared by mixing the synthe- sized catalyst 3 mg with 0.475 μL of isopropanol, 1.425 μL of DI water, and 50 μL of a 5 Naﬁon solution 5 wt, followed by ultrasonication for 25 min to create a homogeneous ink. The resulting catalyst ink was drop-casted onto the glassy carbon electrode at a loading of 20 μg cm2. A thin catalyst layer was formed to ensure that the formed H2O2 was de- tectable at the ring electrode. Once the solvent was evaporated, the WE was deemed ready for experimentation. Before catalytic performance test- ing, precycling was performed using cyclic voltammetry CV. Here, the catalyst was cycled ten times in",

Here, the catalyst was cycled ten times in an Ar-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution with a scan rate of 0.1 V s1 and a scan range of 0.051.0 V. The platinum ring surface was cleaned via CV over 20 cycles at a scan rate of 0.5 V s1 and a scan range of 0.051.0 V. The H2O2 production rate and selectivity were measured in an O2-saturated electrolyte at a scan rate of 0.01 V s1 and a rotation rate of 1600 rpm for the disk electrode. Notably, the platinum ring electrode was maintained at 1.2 V versus RHE, ensuring the exclusive ox- idation of H2O2 generated on the disk electrode. The ORR current was cor- rected by subtracting the current obtained under Ar-saturated conditions from the current measured in the O2-saturated electrolyte. Meanwhile, the ring current was corrected using the RRDE collection eﬃciency to ensure accurate quantiﬁcation of H2O2 generation. The collection eﬃciency of the electrode was determined using a potassium hexacyanoferrate III solution N 0.278, Figure S11, Supporting Information.

The setup included an AgAgCl reference electrode, a graphite rod as the CE, and MoP-pillar- modiﬁed carbon ﬁber paper 0.5 0.5 cm2 as the WE, with a mass loading rate of 0.1 mg cm2. Both the cathode 50 mL and anode compartments were ﬁlled with the same electrolyte. The concentration of produced H2O2 was determined using a colori- metric method. For calibration, H2TiO4 standards were prepared by treat- ing H2O2 solutions concentration range: 0.14.0 mM with 3.8 mL of 0.1 M acidiﬁed titanium sulfate. These standards were examined using an ultravioletvisible spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 407 nm. The standard concentrations and corresponding absorbances at 407 nm are il- lustrated in Figure S13 Supporting Information. A linear calibration curve was created for H2O2 concentrations ranging from 0.14.0 mM. Notably, this calibration is applicable to acidiﬁed titanium sulfate solutions within this concentration range. To determine the concentration of H2O2 in the electrolyte, 0.2 mL of the collected electrolyte was reacted with 3.8 mL of a 0.1 M acidiﬁed titanium sulfate solution, and the results were compared to the linear calibration curve. The total charge ﬂux through the electrode was integrated over time, demonstrating high FE for the instantaneous production of H2O2 and high eﬃciency for its continuous production us- ing chronoamperometry. This high eﬃciency indicates the potential of the system for long-term H2O2 production.

Here, we reform the waterion networks via electrolyte concentration manipulation and electrode construction on atomically flat Au single-crystal surfaces. With the combination of in situ Raman spectroscopy and multifidelity theoretical simulations, we pinpoint H2O with dual hydrogen-bond donors as an observable indicator for nitrate electroreduction NO3RR. A hierarchical configuration characterized by structured Li NO3 planes coupled with enriched hydrogen-bond networks is verified to streamline the reactive intermediates activation and proton transport, thus synergistically boosting NO3RR. We highlight the cooperative modulation of the interfacial waterion interactions and the hydrogen-bond networks in optimizing NO3RR. Our findings unveil microscale viewpoint of synergy between the local ionwater interactions and connectivity of the hydrogen-bonding network. INTRODUCTION As a vanguard of green energy and a pillar of sustainable agriculture, ammonia NH3 stimulates continuous progress in farming, plastics, and chemical industries, epitomizing the intersection where sustainable oversight harmonizes with productive industry.1 The electrochemical reduction of nitrate NO3 promises not only to reinvent sustainable fabrication techniques but also to address the problem of NO3 pollution, which compromises aquatic ecosystems and challenges global nitrogen cycle.2 In the realm of nitrate reduction reaction NO3RR, a delicate balance must be reached and it requires precise modulation to ensure it donates adequate protons for the hydrogenation reaction, meanwhile avoiding engagement in the undesired hydrogen evolution reaction HER.3 This subtle control over the role of interfacial water is pivotal for optimizing the efficiency and selectivity of the NO3RR.4 To decode the mechanism of interfacial electrocatalytic reactions, comprehensive insight into the microstructure structure of the solidliquid interface is imperative. The evolving electric double layer EDL structure inspires accurate depictions of the configuration and connectivity of interfacial hydrogen-bond networks and waterion networks under bias potentials.5,6 The intricate hydrogen-bond networks at interfaces serve as the underlying microscopic origin for the kinetics of electrochemical processes, profoundly impacting the energy conversion efficiency. Ions induce significant perturba- tion to the hydrogen-bond network of interfacial water, critically shaping the characteristics of EDLs. On the one hand, the molecular insights into the dynamics of an electrocatalytic process are rooted in the organization of waterion networks at the interface.7 Notably, the waterion interactions can directly facilitate the activation of reactive species and initiate the reaction, as elucidated in previous work that accumulation of cations at the interface can induce ordered interfacial water structures and accelerate the water dissociation.8 On the other hand, the hydrogen-bond network of interfacial water plays a vital role in proton transfer, a well- recognized key factor influencing the sustainability of the reaction.9 Significantly, these",

In tandem with recognition of the indispensability of high- performance catalysts of the NO3RR, knowledge deficits still exist regarding active phases and reaction kinetics at reconstructed surfaces. Considering the profound impact of the solidelectrolyte interface takes center stage, the properties of electrolyte encompassing cations, anions, H2O content, electrolyte concentration, and pH significantly govern the kinetics of electrocatalytic NO3RR.10,11 Although precise Received: February 13, 2025 Revised: May 30, 2025 Accepted: June 2, 2025 Article pubs.acs.orgJACS XXXX American Chemical Society A https:doi.org10.1021jacs.5c02540 J.

Real-time description of hydrogen- bond networks, distribution, and interactions of ions are essential yet hard to achieve, especially at extreme potentials and high concentrations. Considerable theoretical and experimental efforts have been devoted to achieving a microscopic understanding of ion solvation and hydrogen- bond environments of waterion networks. The characteristics of the cations, such as size and the hydration, have a significant effect on various electrochemical reactions.12,13 Anions in the electrolyte modulate microenvironments proximal to the catalyst surface and affect product distribution, especially when particularly when they serve as primary reactants in interfacial processes such as the electroreduction of NO3 and the formation of a solid electrolyte interface SEI in alkali- metal-ion batteries.14 Recent investigations have unveiled that anions actively engage in the interfacial hydrogen-bond networks, with their decomposition notably promoted in high concentration electrolytes.15 Despite significant advance- ments, the precise architecture of anions, their interplay with cations and water at interfaces, and their fundamental function in governing interfacial reactivity remain enigmatic, remaining a topic of ongoing doubt. Daunting questions for experimental investigation of the EDL structure principally lie in the intricate interplay of interactions and the dynamic evolution of waterion net- works.16 However, harsh electrochemical conditions compli- cate the understanding of interfacial dynamics due to complex waterion interactions and hydrogen-bond fluctuations. As an advanced analytical technique with exceptional surface sensitivity, shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spec- troscopy SHINERS overcomes the material and morpho- logical limitations of conventional surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy SERS and effectively utilized to decipher EDL configurations under specialized scenarios.17,18 In this article, we delve into the interfacial water structure and the reduction dynamics of anions in LiNO3 aqueous electrolytes across varying concentrations on atomically ordered and stable Au",

Au single- crystal surfaces were selected as an ideal platform for probing the structureactivity correlation between interfacial water ion network dynamics and NO3RR activity, leveraging their optimal NO2 adsorption, and inherent suppression of competing hydrogen evolution, which collectively govern selective NH3 formation. Specifically, we note that the ordered LiNO3 planes, with NO3 lying flat against the electrode surface, promotes the activation of adsorbed NO3 under high electrolyte concentrations. Moreover, the hydrogen bonds formed between out-plane NO3 and H2O significantly enrich hydrogen-bond networks at the interface and further accelerate NO3RR. Notably, through modulating the crystallographic orientation and electronic structure of the electrode, the NO3RR was further enhanced by rational constructing the interfacial waterion networks. Our findings suggest that strategically modulating waterion interactions and the Figure 1. Solvation structures of LiNO3 solutions. A OH stretching band of bulk LiNO3 solutions and pure water.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Solvation Structure of LiNO3 Solutions. The LiNO3 solutions across a wide range of molar ratios of LiNO3 to H2O 1:555 to 1:2.5 were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, as shown in Figures 1A and S3. As the concentration of LiNO3 increases, the structure of water in the solution undergoes significant changes and the OH vibration modes of water molecules, which are highly sensitive to the organization of water and intermolecular interactions, provide valuable insight into this transition. As the concentration increases, the width of the OH stretching vibration peak progressively narrows, accompanied by a decrease in its intensity, indicating the formation of more structured water networks. Additionally, the blue-shift of the OH stretching vibration suggests a strengthening of the OH bond, implying a higher energy requirement for bond disruption and a weakening of the hydrogen-bond network. The Raman profile of the hydrate crystal LixH2O is shown in Figure S4 and its OH band deconvolved into four components Figure 1B, specifically, 3286 cm1, 3374 cm1, 3490 cm1, and 3545 cm1. These spectral features are indicative of a polymer-like chain, which is enveloped by nitrate ions through electrostatic interactions. This crystal structure forms a critical foundation for deducing the arrangement in superconcentrated LiNO3 solutions.19 The structure of this crystal serves as a significant basis for inferring the structure of superconcentrated LiNO3 solution.

The Raman data demonstrate the transition of the water molecule structure from isolated units to clusters, ultimately forming a polymer-like chain, as visualized in the inset scheme in Figure 1B. The concentration dependence of the chemical shift, observed through proton nuclear magnetic resonance 1H NMR spectroscopy at varying LiNO3 concentrations, is illustrated in Supporting Information Figure S5 and their 1H chemical shift are shown in Figure 1C. From 1:555 to 1:4, the 1H signal of water molecules progressively shifts from 4.84 to 4.68 ppm. This shift is attributed to a decrease in electron density near the protons, resulting from amplified long- distance interactions between water molecules, signaling the formation of larger water networks. Intriguingly, at higher concentrations, the 1H signal shifts further upfield, indicating a reduction in hydrogen bond density and an increase in LiOH water oxygen interactions. To further correlate the water structure with electrochemical activity, steady-state polar- ization curves were recorded and are presented in Figure 1D. As the concentration increases, the onset potential of the overall reduction reaction shifts positively, indicating enhanced interfacial reduction activity. These findings suggest that the dominant mechanism governing the interfacial activity extends beyond the influence of ionwater interactions in bulk solutions. Instead, the critical role of the water network at the interface warrants further investigation. In Situ Probing of the EDL Structures. Electrochemical SHINERS were employed to probe the EDL structures on Auhkl in LiNO3 electrolytes, donoted as AuhklLiNO3, across a range of concentrations 1:555 to 1:2.5, with detailed Figure 2.

The broad peak from 3520 cm1 to 3300 cm1 is attributed to the OH stretching vibration of interfacial water. Through a combined approach employing Gaussian fitting methodology and theoretical simulations Figures S18S23, we identified three distinct components within the OH stretching band of interfacial water based on the donor number of hydrogen bonds,20 specifically, H2O with 2 donors H2ON2 around 32003300 cm1, H2O with 1 donor H2ON1 around 33003500 cm1, and H2O without any donor H2ON0 above 3500 cm1.

The potential- dependent proportion change of each component is quantified and illustrated in Figure 2B by columns. Notably, the population of H2ON2 and H2ON0 increases evidently with the negative going potential, while that of H2ON1 decreases, consistent with the results of classical molecular dynamics simulations, as indicated by the dotted lines. The observed increase in H2ON0, predominantly comprised cation-coordinated water LiH2O, which could be attributed to the electrostatic attraction exerted by the negatively charged electrode.21 Intriguingly, the rise in the H2ON2 population contradicts the conventional cation-dominated paradigm, where accumulated cations at negative potentials typically disrupt the hydrogen-bond network, leading to a more structured interfacial water layer. The anomalous rise in H2ON2 may stem from the interactions between H2O and NO3 , which is influenced by the hydrogen bond affinity of NO3 . In situ Raman experiments conducted with 1:11 LiClO4 Figure S7 and LiCl Figure S8 further support this interpretation, as evidenced by the decrease of H2ON2 with increasingly negative potentials. These differences arise from the structural diversity of anions and their varied interactions with H2O. The NO3 can be safely regarded as hydrophilic, whereas ClO4 and Clown slightly hydrophobic nature, as confirmed by previous studies.22,23 The observed increase in H2ON2 populations at negative potentials arises from the unique dual role of NO3 as a hydrogen-bond acceptor and a structural linker. This anomaly reflects nitrates ability to form LiNO3 H2O coordination clusters under interfacial electric fields, which reorganize water networks into dense H-bonded configurations. The involvement of NO3 in the EDL significantly alters the characteristics of the interfacial hydrogen-bond networks, which also triggers its own electro- chemical conversion. To further investigate the electrochemical behavior, linear sweep voltammetry LSV experiments were carried out in 1:11 LiNO3, NaNO3, and NaClO4 electrolytes. The results showed an early onset potential and an increase in the reduction current, indicating the presence of an additional reduction process in the NO3 -containing electrolytes Figure S2A. Gas chromatography GC measurements were subsequently utilized Figures 2C and S14 to evaluate the NO3RR.24 The formation of nitrite NO2 results directly from the detachment of oxygen from NO3 , whereas NH3 represents a product of an eight-electron reduction. As presented in Figure 2C, the NO2and NH3 yield rates Figure 3. Atomic insights of the EDL at the 1:11 Au111LiNO3 interface.

XXXX, XXX, XXXXXX D escalate as the potential gets negative, correlating with the proportion change of H2ON2. This observation further indicates that the conversion of NO3 to NO2 constitutes the rate-determining step in synthesizing NH3 from NO3 on transition metals, consistent with prior studies.25 Atomic Insights of EDL Structures. Multifidelity MD simulations were employed to further rationalize the atomic- level structure of the EDL structure at the 1:11 Au111 LiNO3 interface Figure S18. The lithium density profile Figure 3A reveals a pronounced enrichment of Li as the potential becomes more negative. Remarkably, NO3 demon- strates a pronounced double-peak distribution close to the surface Figure 3A. The complex interplay of forces from negatively charged Au and accumulated Li contributes to the constant intensity of NO3 closest to the interface and they are predominantly coordinated with three Li ions Figure 3B. The 3LiNO3 planes are nearly parallel to the interface, as evidenced by calculated angles between the normal NO3 plane and the Au111 interface Figure 3C. The N atom in 3LiNO3 of the first peak is positioned closer to the interface Figures 3B and S28, facilitating charge exchange with the electrode. Furthermore, the coordination of Li with the oxygen of NO3 results in elongation of the NO bond Figure S29, thereby promoting the activation of NO3 NO3 NO2 O. The slow growth method was applied to quantificationally calculate the activation ability of oxygen in NO3 Figure 3D, revealing that Li coordination significantly lowers the activation energy of oxygen.26 Thus, the 3LiNO3 complex exhibits the highest activity due to the coordination of its three oxygen atoms with Li. Regarding the second peak associated with NO3 anions, its intensity is observed to increase as the potential shifts negative. This enhancement is attributed to the predominance of the attractive force exerted by lithium ions on NO3 , which adopts a configuration that is more perpendicular to the interface Figure S26 and exhibits reduced interaction with Li Figure S27. Consequently, the intensification of NO3 in the second layer is responsible for the growing population of H2ON2, owing to the inherent capacity of unbound NO3 to serve as a hydrogen-bond acceptors. For further confirmation, we quantified the instances of NO3 as hydrogen-bonds acceptors Figure 3E, and the analysis indicated that more hydrogen bonds",

The strengthened connectivity of the hydrogen-bond networks facilitates proton transfer to the interface,27,28 which is essential for the conversion of NO2 to ammonia via proton-coupled electron transfer steps. Figure 3F encapsulates the atomic bilayer EDL structure at the 1:11 Au111LiNO3 interface, illustrating both the NO3 activation process and hydrogen bond enrichment. In this scenario, the nitrite yield rate and the population of H2ON2 are proposed to mirror the ammonia yield rate. Moreover, the H2ON2 population serves not only as a direct indicator of the EDL structure but also as a predictive descriptor of the NO3RR activity. Concentration-Dependent EDL Evolution.

XXXX, XXX, XXXXXX E reduction activity were further investigated under varied LiNO3 concentrations. Notably, the H2ON2 population and yield rates of the products exhibited a volcanic-like dependence on concentration with a maximum of 1:11 LiNO3 Figures 4A and S15. The interplay between NO3 and interfacial hydrogen-bond networks, alongside the reduction behavior, underscores a distinct structurefunction relationship within the EDL. Variations in the H2ON2 population with bias potential were analyzed in both diluted and superconcentrated solutions, as illustrated in Figure 4B,C, respectively. In diluted electrolytes, the limited availability of LiNO3 in the bulk solution restricts the presence of both Li and NO3 at the interface. This scarcity results in a more inclined configuration to interact with H2O at relatively positive potentials Figure S31, thereby impeding the activation of NO3 . Concurrently, although unbound NO3 can enhance the hydrogen-bond network of interfacial water, the Li ions dominate the hydrogen-bond networks due to their propensity to aggregate near the interface inset in Figure 4B. Consequently, this results in a decreasing trend in H2ON2 at less negative potentials. In contrast, at a highly negative potential, the electric field draws an abundance of Li and NO3 to the interface, facilitating the formation of a distinct NO3 bilayer. This leads to an increase in the H2ON2 population, thus boosting the NO3RR efficiency. In more concentrated electrolyte solutions, a less negative potential is required to organize the NO3 bilayer and more H2ON2 is formed correspondently, correlating with enhanced efficiency in NO3RR. However, at excessively high concentrations, a",

In more concentrated electrolyte solutions, a less negative potential is required to organize the NO3 bilayer and more H2ON2 is formed correspondently, correlating with enhanced efficiency in NO3RR. However, at excessively high concentrations, a significant decrease in the number of water molecules was observed alongside a considerable enrichment of Li ions at the interface. This leads to the phenomenon that nearly all of the oxygen atoms of interfacial NO3 are coordinated with Li, rendering them incapable of forming hydrogen bonds with water molecules the insets are shown in Figures 4C and S32. The weak interaction between the NO3 and water molecules results in less connected hydrogen-bond networks within the EDL. In the context of superconcentrated LiNO3, which exhibits a polymer-like structure Figure S4,19 the formation of stable LiH2O2n chain maintains a constant population of H2ON2 population, with minimal variation with changes in potential. The reduction of NO3 is thus impeded in superconcentrated Au111LiNO3 on account of structural obstacles and a scarcity of available H2O. A schematic of the concentration-dependent interfacial solvation structure on Au111LiNO3 is shown in Figure 4D. The crystallographic orientation and electronic structure of the electrode significantly impact the interfacial waterion networks. We further monitored the NO3RR efficiency by tuning the waterion network through varying the crystallo- graphic orientations of Au single-crystal surfaces Figures S10, S11. The product Figures 5A and S16 yield rates follow the order Au111 Au110 Au100, sharing a similar trend with the corresponding H2ON2 population. The more positive point of zero charge PZC indicates a higher surface charge density on the Au111 surface, thereby facilitating the organization of the interfacial bilayer structure.29 The surface structure thus directly impacts the formation of an efficient EDL, highlighting the critical role of crystallographic orientation in the design of electrocatalytic interfaces. Building on these findings, we designed a heterostructure by spontaneously adsorbing Sn onto the Au111 surface to further enhance the nitrate reduction activity. The Au111-Sn demonstrated superior NH3 and NO2 yield rate Figures 5A, S2B, S16 and S17, alongside the highest proportion of H2ON2 Figure S12, which could be attributed to the suppression of the competing HER by Sn.30 The hetero- structure design of Au111-Sn underscores the importance of combining different materials to leverage synergistic effects, where Sn acts to optimize the interfacial waterion networks and further enhances the catalytic performance shown in Figure 5B. The activation energy for dissociation of NO3 with Li-coordinated oxygen on Au111-Sn was calculated by AIMD Figure S33. The activation energy decreases to 0.96 eV on Au111-Sn, revealing Sn-induced electron redistrib- ution facilitates nitrate adsorption and activation. These findings indicate that the EDL structures share similarities at these electrodes, and the variance in the electrocatalytic performance is primarily derived from the efficiency in orchestrating the bilayer structure, as evidenced by H2ON2 populations.

Abstract: Electrochemical oxidation of organic nucleophiles to value- added chemicals using nickel-based catalysts is promising yet hindered by the dynamic evolution of nickel coordination structures during catalysis. Herein, we engineered atomically exposed nickel molecular catalysts anchored on functional carbon black through tailored aromatic ligands coordination. This unique spatial coordination structure efficiently promotes the reconstruction of high- valence NiIII-OOH sites, which boost electrooxidation of 18 organic substrates with peak current density exceeding 800 mA cm-2. Especially, the optimal electrocatalyst achieves record mass activities of 4.38 and 4.26 A mgNi-1 for methanol and ethylene glycol oxidation, respectively. In-situ characterization and theoretical analyses elucidate that the atomically exposed NiIII-OOH centers would directly adsorb organic substrates, thereby enhancing C-CC-H bonds cleavage efficiency. Meanwhile, the proton abstraction from C-H bond would enable reversible redox cycling between NiII-OH and NiIII-OOH, sustaining catalytic activity. This study advances the understanding of organic oxidation mechanisms and showcases the great potential of molecular complexes in electrocatalysis. Introduction Replacing the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction OER by electrooxidation of organic substrates have demonstrated with low energy consumption for hydrogen H2 productions at cathode and value-added chemicals and fuel generations at anode1. In particular, this technology with mild operation conditions shows significant promise in various fields, such as biomass update2, raw materials processing3, waster plastic cycle4, and wastewater pollution treatments5 Figure 1a. Recently, nickel- based catalysts are particularly advantageous for catalyzing organic electrooxidation6, exhibiting much lower onset potential than OER7.

Recently, nickel- based catalysts are particularly advantageous for catalyzing organic electrooxidation6, exhibiting much lower onset potential than OER7. The in-situ generation of nickel oxide hydroxide NiOOH species with highly electrophilic lattice oxygen atoms endows their efficiently electrochemical activity8,9. However, the immovable lattice oxygen species in bulk NiOOH would shield the directly adsorption of reactants on Ni sites10 Figure 1b, thus leading to low accessibility of nickel sites and limited diffusion rates of reactant. These drawbacks account for slow organics oxidation reaction kinetics, limiting current density to below 500 mA cm-211. Furthermore, for electrooxidation of polyhydric alcohols, the sluggish cleavage of CC bonds leads to unsatisfied reaction activities and product selectivity12. Although the oxygen vacancy-mediated strategies have been proposed13, the limited availability of oxygen vacancies depress the catalytic efficiency, and the mechanisms behind CC bonds cleavage are still not fully understood. Therefore, it is still challenging to properly adjust the structure and surface properties of Ni-based catalysts to fully expose metal sites for advancing organics oxidation processes. In metalloprotein enzymes, organic ligands coordinating with metallic sites have demonstrated the ability to fine-tune catalytic environments, significantly impacting enzyme catalytic efficiency14. The artificial organic-metal hybrids, such as metal- organic frameworks MOFs and coordination polymers featured with the flexible coordination environments15, have also exhibited unexpected catalytic activities and selectivity in various fields16, providing great potential to overcome the innate limitation of traditional catalysts. However, the organic electrooxidation is mainly proceeded on the near-surface regions of a catalyst, thereby the bulk organic-metal hybrids with poor conductivity and complicated structural reconstructions would disturb the essential understanding of structure-activity relationships17. Additionally, the low accessibility of inner catalytic sites limit catalytic efficiency, and the occupied metal orbitals fail to directly activate the CC bonds18. Therefore, at the atomic scale, creating molecularly dispersed organic-metal hybrid catalysts with coordinatively unsaturated states is essential for uncovering the reaction mechanisms of organic oxidation process. Herein, we developed a series of nickel-based isostructural molecular complexes through coordinating nickel ions with aromatic carboxylate ligands on conductive carbon substrates. The π-π stacking interactions between aromatic ligands and the carbon support efficiently stabilize the highly accessible nickel sites. Especially, the geometric diversity of ligands provides high flexibility in regulating the coordination environments and electron structures of nickel sites supported, which is key for the dynamic generation of highly accessible NiIII-OOH sites via sequential OH- nucleophilic attack and dehydrogenation. These hypervalent NiIII- OOH sites with electrophilic oxygen enable superior electrocatalytic oxidation of 18 organic molecules with high- current density over 800 mA cm-2. In particular, methanol and ethylene glycol EG oxidation achieved high mass activities of 4.38 and 4.26 A mgNi-1 at 1.45 V, respectively. In situ characteristics and theoretical analysis confirm that the atomically exposed nickel sites would benefit CH and CC bond cleavage via unoccupied nickel d orbitals Figure 1c, aided by OH- nucleophilic attack. Simultaneously, the electrophilic oxygen species in NiIII-OOH facilitate proton abstraction from CH",

This work would provide a foundational understanding of electrocatalytic oxidation mechanisms and highlight the potential of molecular complexes for advanced catalytic applications. Results and Discussion A series of isostructural Ni-based molecular complexes were synthesized by assembling of Ni2 ions with various aromatic organic linkers on oxidzied Ketjenblack OKB Figure 2a, referred to as Ni-PTAOKB, Ni-BPDAOKB, and Ni-PTDAOKB, respectively. Importantly, the different geometry configurations and molecular structures of these aromatic ligands allow rational manipulation of the π-π stacking interactions between the molecular complexes and OKB supports19. The oxygen functional groups on carbon support would also facilitate the anchoring of nickel-ligand coordination sites through strong π-π stacking interactions. Transmission electron microscopy TEM images reveal that the OKB supports are coralloid nanostructure with an average branch size of 3040 nm Figure S1. The absence of MOFs sheets in these Ni-based molecular complexes suggests that the nickel sites are molecurlarly dispersed on the carbon supports Figure 2b and Figure S2-S3. For comparison, the direct assembling Ni2 ion with aromatic ligands in the absence of OKB support leads to the formation of nickelbased MOFs layers Ni-MOL with 2D nanosheets structure Figure S4. Xray diffraction patterns of these Ni-based molecular complexes only display the characteristic diffraction peaks of carbon substrate Figure S5-S6, confirming the molecular dispersion of nickel sites. Furthermore, high-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM HAADF-STEM of Ni-BPDAOKB exhibits isolated bright dots marked by yellow circles on carbon support, unveiling the atomic dispersion of nickel centers Figure 2c and Figure S7. STEM elemental mapping and line scanning results demonstrate the uniform distribution of Ni elements on carbon supports Figure S8-S9. Then, Fourier transform infrared FTIR spectra show noticeable redshifts of the vCO peak to 1600 cm-1 and the vC-O peak to 1385 cm-1 in these molecular complexes, compared with the organic ligands, attributed to the coordination between nickel ion and carboxylic acid group Figure S10.

Besides, no Ni-Ni or Ni-O-Ni bond in EXAFS spectrum can be detected, confirming the atomical dispersion of nickel sites in Ni- BPDAOKB. Electrocatalytic performance Cyclic voltammetry CV curves were conducted to investigate the NiII to NiIII oxidation Figure 3a. The Ni-BPDAOKB exhibit a pronounced quasi-reversible redox peak at 1.26 V compared to Ni-PTDAOKB at 1.27 V and Ni-PTAOKB at 1.30 V, indicating an easier redox process for NiIINiIII in Ni-BPDAOKB21. This can be contributed to fast electron transferring between molecular complexes and OKB substrate through the strong π-π stacking interactions20c.

Methanol oxidation reaction MOR is employed to evaluate CH bond cleavage kinetics in 1.0 M KOH Figure S26-S27. The Ni-based molecular complexes show faster reaction kinetics than that of corresponding bulk Ni-MOL, indicating the superior catalytic performance due to the highly accessible nickel sites Figure S28. Besides, the Ni-BPDAOKB only requires 1.47 V to reach a current density of 400 mA cm-2, significantly lower than those of Ni-PTDAOKB 1.52 V and Ni-PTAOKB 1.55 V Figure 3c. The ratios of overpotential η to current density logj for Ni-BPDAOKB is lowest 200 mV dec-1, indicating the fastest reaction kinetics Figure 3d and Figure S2922. The outstanding catalytic performance of Ni-BPDAOKB can be attributed to rapid electron transfer between the molecular complexes and carbon substrates. Ion chromatography IC and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance NMR spectroscopy analyses revealed the high Faradaic efficiencies FE of formate production, exceeding 94 under various applied potentials Figure S30-S31. Besides, the potential-dependent Nyquist and Bode plots obtained from in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirmed the fast electron transfer Figure S32. The long-term durability test performed at 1.4 V and 1.5 V without iR compensation demonstrate the stability of Ni-organic coordination structures during electrooxidation Figure S33. Ethylene glycol oxidation reaction EGOR studies showed similar catalytic behaviors as MOR, with Ni-BPDAOKB exhibiting high catalytic efficiency for CC bond cleavage Figure 3e. The Ni-BPDAOKB achieve an ultra-high current density of 800 mA cm-2 at 1.59 V, outperforming previously reported EGOR catalysts with current density below 500 mA cm-2 Figure S34 and Table S3. In contrast, the Ni-BPDA-MOL shows much slower EGOR catalytic kinetic than that of MOR. This slower rate is attributed to the sluggish CC bond breaking on saturated Ni-BPDA-MOL with fewer accessible nickel sites. However, the Ni-BPDAOKB shows an ultra-high EGOR mass activity of 4.26 A mgNi-1 at 1.45 V, which is 13 times higher than that of Ni-BPDA-MOL Figure 3f. IC and 1H NMR spectra confirmed the high FE of formate production across a wide range of potentials Figure 3g and Figure S35-S36, resulting from the effective cleavage of CC bonds.

This structural advantage highlights the significance of atomically dispersed nickel sites in enhancing catalytic activity for organic oxidations. The dynamical structural evolution and reaction pathways on Ni-BPDAOKB were further elucidated using in situ Raman measurements in different electrolytes Figure S37-S38. Under OER conditions, new Raman bands appear at 471 and 552 cm-1 with a potential of 1.30 V Figure 4a, assigning to the bending and stretching vibrations of Ni3-O structures in γ-NiIII-OOH24, respectively. These characteristic bands of NiIII-O remained stable after reactions Figure S39, indicating that the NiIII-OOH structure once formed, is irreversible during OER. In comparison, during MOR, the bending and stretching vibration peaks show a blue shift to 476 and 560 cm-1, respectively, suggesting the weakened NiIII-O bond in NiIII-OOH Figure 4b. Interestingly, upon removal of the voltage input, the NiIII-OOH species gradually disappeared after 60 s, thus demonstrating the transient nature of these active sites Figure 4c and Figure S40. The transient NiIII- OOH with highly electrophilic oxygen species, facilitates proton abstraction from α-CH bonds, thereby achieving a reversible redox process between NiII-OH and NiIII-OOH and the regeneration of coordination structures in Ni-BPDAOKB. In situ Raman spectra also reveal that the NiIII-OOH formation is driven by the dehydrogenation of OH adsorbed on highly oxidative nickel atoms Figure 4d.

    "text": "structures in Ni-BPDAOKB. In situ Raman spectra also reveal that the NiIII-OOH formation is driven by the dehydrogenation of OH adsorbed on highly oxidative nickel atoms Figure 4d. To further explore the dynamic reconstruction of NiIII-OOH, CV curves were conducted with varying organic substrate concentrations. At high substrate concentrations, the CV curves of MOR and EGOR exhibit high current density during the negative scan, thus indicating a hysteresis effect Figure 4e and Figure S41. The hysteresis can be interpreted by the insufficient NiIII-OOH active sites during the initial positive scan, demonstrating that the favorable adsorption of organic substrates would compete with the formation of active NiIII-OOH. This standpoint can also be confirmed by the delayed MOR onset potential and the weakening of NiII NiIII redox peaks at higher methanol concentrations Figure S42-S43. Furthermore, the pristine Ni-BPDAOKB presents increasing current density over time, demonstrating a self-activation process wherein Ni sites undergo gradual structural reconstruction to form NiIII-OOH species Figure S44. Compared with Ni-BPDAOKB, the Ni- BPDAOKB-OOH obtained by direct activation in 1.0 M KOH, exhibits a lower MOR onset potential but suboptimal catalytic performance at high-current densities Figure S45, likely due to disrupted coordination structures. The above findings demonstrate that the NiIII-OOH species, featuring highly electrophilic oxygen atoms and atomically exposed nickel sites, play a pivotal role in driving the oxidation of organic substrates. Meanwhile, intensive proton transfer from activated CH bonds ensure structural stability by reduction of the active centers. Then in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy XAS analysis under MOR conditions has been conducted. As shown in Figure 5a, b, the Ni K-edge gradually shifts to higher energy as the applied potential increases from open circuit potential OCP to 1.5 V, indicating an increase in the oxidation state of Ni species. This high valence state is attributed to the dynamic structure evolution of Ni-ligand coordination structure in alkaline conditions. The spent Ni-BPDAOKB catalyst after MOR shows a lower Ni valence state compared to that after OER, thus indicating the presence of a reversible NiIII-OOH center during MOR. Figure 4.

The Ni- BPDAOKB after MOR only exhibits a Ni-O bond at 2.07 Å, similar with that in pristine Ni-BPDAOKB, indicating a reversible redox cycle between NiIII-OOH and center NiII-OH. Conversely, the Ni- BPDAOKB after OER shows a prominent Ni-O bond at 2.05 Å and a weak Ni-O-Ni bond at 3.17 Å Tables S4-S8, suggesting the formation of irreversible NiIII-OOH centers under these conditions. For Ni 2p XPS spectra, the Ni-BPDAOKB exhibits a slight increase in the valence states of Ni after MOR Figure 5d, which is consistent with XAS analysis. Furthermore, the HAADF- STEM image of Ni-BPDAOKB after prolonged MOR show isolated bright dots marked by yellow circle Figure 5e, demonstrating the stable nickel-ligand coordination structures. Mechanism investigation To further understand the pathways of organic oxidation on electrophilic transient NiIII-OOH sites, the attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared adsorption spectroscopy ATR-SEIRAS was conducted Figure S49. Before MOR, the vC-OH peak at 1228 cm-1 Figure 6a and Figure S50 indicates the favorable adsorption of methanol on coordinatively unsaturated nickel sites. This is primarily due to the feasible electron donation from the σ-orbital of -OH group into the vacant d orbital of Ni2 centers. As the potential increases above 1.35 V, this peak weakens, suggesting the consumption of methanol adsorbed. Besides, the emergence of a new v-COO peak at 1580 cm-1 confirms the formation of CHOO-. Density functional theory calculations further elucidate the reaction pathways, using a model with nickel sites coordinated to two ligands Figure S51-S52. The Ni-BPDAOKB exhibits the highest π-π stacking energy between Ni-molecular complexes and carbon substrate Figure 6b, which would facilitate electron transfer. The π-π stacking interactions are influenced by both the length of aromatic nucleus and the geometry of organic ligands. The BPDA ligand, with longer benzene ring, leads to stronger π-π stacking interactions in Ni-BPDAOKB compared to Ni-PTAOKB. In contrast, the Ni-PTDAOKB",

The π-π stacking interactions are influenced by both the length of aromatic nucleus and the geometry of organic ligands. The BPDA ligand, with longer benzene ring, leads to stronger π-π stacking interactions in Ni-BPDAOKB compared to Ni-PTAOKB. In contrast, the Ni-PTDAOKB with longest benzene ring exhibits lower π-π stacking due to the reduced overlap of π-electron clouds caused by the off-plane conformations of PTDA ligands Figure S53. This is further supported by Mulliken atomic charge analysis, which shows the highest valence state of Ni sites in Ni- BPDAOKB Figure S54-S55. An exponent relationship is observed between NiII-OH dehydrogenation energy and π-π stacking energy for Ni-based molecular complexes Figure 6c and Figure S56. This result unveils that the strong π-π stacking interactions would promote the dehydrogenation of NiII-OH structure, thus facilitating the reconstruction of hypervalent NiIII- OOH. The reaction pathways for electrocatalytic MOR were investigated, starting with methanol adsorbed on NiII-OH sites, followed by a stepwise dehydrogenation process. Optimized adsorption configurations and corresponding Gibbs energy diagrams reveal that the spontaneous dehydrogenation of OH bonds in methanol can be driven by the highly oxidative NiIII-OOH species Figure 6d and Figure S57. Proton abstraction from CH bonds can be significantly facilitated by the electrophilic oxygen atoms in NiIII-OOH compared to NiII-OH Figure 6e and Figure S58. Importantly, this proton abstraction process not only benefits the activation and dehydrogenation of CH bonds, but also aids in the reduction of NiIII-OOH to NiII-OH. Additionally, CHO intermediates, formed from the dehydrogenation of CH2O, Figure 5.

The Gibbs energy diagram unveils that the electrocatalytic conversion of CHO to CO is thermodynamically unfavorable ΔG 2.9 eV, confirming the selective production of formate over CO2. The EGOR process was also calculated to analyze the kinetics of CC bonds cleavage. Coordinatively unsaturated nickel sites would facilitate the direct adsorption of EG, and continuous dehydrogenation results in the formation of CHO- CHO intermediate on nickel sites Figure 6f and Figure S60. The CHO-CHO intermediate undergo CC bond cleavage on nickel sites, assisted by the OH- nucleophilic attack, thus leading to the rapid formate production.

Additionally, the Pourbaix diagrams, derived from pH-dependent catalytic activity tests, exhibit that the slope of Ni-BPDAOKB is consistently around 122 mV pH-1 Figure 6h and Figure S61. Thus, the high slope demonstrates that the EG oxidation can be significantly influenced by the OH- nucleophilic attack26. Overall, the organic electrooxidation processes on Ni- based molecular complexes are illustrated in Figure 6i. The hypervalent NiIII-OOH species, acting as proton acceptors, facilitate the dehydrogenation of CH bonds through rapid proton abstraction, which helps regenerate the Ni-organic coordination centers. The direct adsorption of organic substrates on atomically exposed nickel sites would promote CC bond cleavage via the activation of Ni d orbital. Additionally, the OH- nucleophilic attack can also assist in CC bonds cleavage and formate formation. Conclusion A series of molecular complexes were developed by coordinating aromatic organic ligands with nickel on oxygen-functional ketjenblack. This configuration is optimized to modulate the Ni- organic coordination structure for dynamic generation of NiIII-OOH. Typically, the Ni-BPDAOKB electrocatalyst demonstrated the ability to electrooxidize 18 different substrate molecules. Especially, the methanol and EG oxidation achieved high mass activity of 4.38 and 4.26 A mgNi-1 at 1.45 V, respectively. In situ characterizations and theoretical analysis revealed that the atomically exposed NiIII-OOH sites with unoccupied d orbital enable direct adsorption of organic reactants, thus achieving feasible CH and CC bonds cleavage. The proton abstraction from CH bonds to NiIII-OOH can induce the reversible redox transition between NiII-OH and NiIII-OOH, thereby stabilizing the coordination structures. This study provides essential insights into the mechanisms of organic nucleophile oxidation on innovative molecular complexes sites.

However, optimizing electrocatalytic performance in the coupled hydrogen evolution reaction HER and MOR requires precise regulation of the electrochemical coordination environment and a fundamental understanding of activity origins, posing a signiﬁcant challenge. Here, a scalable strategy is developed that harnesses the high electronegativity of ﬂuorine F to tailor the coordination environment of Ni3N, enhancing HER kinetics. Concurrently, adsorbed F ions induce rapid and extensive self-reconstruction of the Ni3N surface during MOR by dynamically modulating interfacial ion concentrations OHand Ni species. This reconstruction enhances catalytic activity and enables the selective oxidation of methanol to formate via a sequential pathway, involving primary O-H bond activation followed by subsequent C-H bond cleavage at Ni active sites. Consequently, F10-Ni3N demonstrates exceptional bifunctional performance, delivering 2.02 V and remarkable stability 600 h for MOR-coupled hydrogen production in a membrane electrode assembly-based ﬂow electrolyzer at an industrially relevant current density of 200 mA cm2. This work establishes a dual-regulation paradigm for electrocatalysts, oﬀering mechanistic insights into surface reconstruction and a rational design framework for next-generation energy conversion systems. 1.

Non-noble metal nickel Ni-based materials, such as nitrides like Ni3N, show great potential for industrial applications in HER and MOR due to their high catalytic activity, unique electronic structures, and enhanced surface morphologies.7 In addition, as HER catalysts, even partial active sites on the low-index facets of Ni3N show Pt-like hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy ΔGH theoretically.8 However, the weak Ni-N interaction and the interstitial occupation of N typically result in elevated unoc- cupied orbital energy, particularly for Ni atoms distant from N atoms, which consequently leads to a weak capability for water activation. Furthermore, the hollow sites far from N atoms with stronger ΔGH constrain the HER dynamics severely.5f,9 Con- currently, Ni3N catalysts have been widely studied for electrocat- alytic biomass oxidation owing to their excellent capacity to ac- tivate C-H or O-H bonds.10 Additionally, as for non-noble Ni- based catalysts, in situ-generated oxyhydroxides during MOR Adv. Mater. 2025, 2507573 2025 Wiley-VCH GmbH 2507573 1 of 14 www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advmat.de are usually regarded as real active sites for pre-catalysts.11 How- ever, most nickel-based MOR pre-catalysts exhibit sluggish sur- face self-reconstruction processes and low electrical conductiv- ity, which signiﬁcantly reduce the MOR rate, increase energy consumption, and severely hinder their practical applications.12 Therefore, the reasonable design of the surface structure of Ni- based catalysts to accelerate the formation of favorable NiOHO sites under low voltage remains a critical challenge in MOR. Meanwhile, a deeper understanding of precatalysts reconstruc- tion essentials and methanols dissociation mechanism on MOR- activated surfaces, particularly at the atomic level, is imperative. Based on the abovementioned concerns, a rational bipolar de- sign of the catalyst is beneﬁcial to achieve high-performance bi- functional materials for both MOR and HER applications. Typ- ically, the performance of catalysts is largely determined by the chemical structure of outer or sublayer atoms surrounding the surface active sites that directly interact with reactant species.13 Therefore, rationally tuning the surface micro-structure of Ni3N to achieve eﬃcient bi-functional HER and MOR is critical. Pre- cise surface functionalization of catalysts is a crucial strategy for modulating their chemical and structural properties, enhancing catalytic performances, and accelerating their self-reconstruction process. The ﬂuorine F element, with the strongest electroneg- ativity 3.98, is expected to serve as an ideal surface modiﬁer for Ni3N due to its strong ability to attract electrons.14 Recent stud- ies suggest that ﬂuoride ions form strong metal-ﬂuorine bonds by coordinating with the surface metal of catalysts, owing to their unique structural characteristics. This bonding enhances ionic interactions, thereby modulating the electronic structure of the active sites.15 Furthermore, ﬂuoride incorporation has been shown to improve catalyst conductivity, which",

This bonding enhances ionic interactions, thereby modulating the electronic structure of the active sites.15 Furthermore, ﬂuoride incorporation has been shown to improve catalyst conductivity, which facilitates in situ dynamic surface reconstruction. As a result, the pre-catalyst un- dergoes a favorable transformation into the active high-valent nickel oxide phase under electrooxidation conditions.14a Herein, we report the controllable synthesis of surface Fion modiﬁed Ni3N nanosheets composed of nanoparticles on metal- lic Ni using a hydrothermal method and sequential nitriding treatment. Under alkaline conditions, these modiﬁed nanosheets exhibit higher electrocatalytic activity for HER and high selec- tivity for MOR. Multifaceted characterization and analysis reveal that the F anions occupy surface inactive sites on the Ni3N sur- face, forming strong ion bonds, and act as activity centers or pro- moters to enhance water dissociation and proton transfer col- lectively. Additionally, the ﬂuoride incorporation increases sur- face ion concentration OH, and Ni2, promoting in situ rapid dynamic surface self-reconstruction and converting the original F10-Ni3N into a loosely and amorphous metal oxide under MOR conditions. Moreover, combined with the in-situ attenuated to- tal reﬂectance Fourier-transform infrared ATR-FTIR spectrum and the density functional theory DFT calculations, reveals that methanol molecular dehydrogenation involves primary O- H bond activation and secondary C-H bond activation steps at Ni surface sites. The calculated thermodynamic energy barrier for the MOR reveals that the CHO coupling with OH- is a potential determination step. Lastly, a bipolar design system demonstrates F10-Ni3N exhibits outstanding performance 2.02 V and remark- able stability up to 600 h in MOR-coupled hydrogen production within a membrane electrode assembly-based ﬂow electrolyzer at an industrially relevant current density of 200 mA cm2. 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Material Synthesis and Characterization The Ni3N and F-modiﬁed Ni3N catalysts grown on Ni foam were prepared by the hydrothermal method and subsequent nitrid- ing treatment as schemed in Figure 1a. Three distinct samples with varying F concentrations were synthesized: pristine Ni3N denoted as Ni3N, F-modiﬁed Ni3N with 10 mmol F precursor F10-Ni3N, and F-modiﬁed Ni3N with 15 mmol F precursor F15- Ni3N. Their stoichiometric proportions were conﬁrmed using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy EDX, as shown in Table S1, Supporting Information. The bulk chemical structures were further conﬁrmed by X-ray diﬀraction XRD patterns as shown in Figure 1b. The three prominent peaks located at 44.5, 70.3, and 78.1 correspond to the 111, 300, and 113 planes of Ni3N, respectively.7c The chemical bonding state of Ni3N, F10- Ni3N, and F15-Ni3N were examined through Raman spectroscopy Figure S1, Supporting Information. The peaks observed at 204 and 536 cm1 in the spectrum could be attributed to Raman- active vibration modes of Ni3N.10a Compared to Ni3N, the Ra- man characteristic peak of F10-Ni3N and F15-Ni3N compared with Ni3N exhibits a red shift from 536 to 523 cm1, indicating that introducing F ions alters the chemical environment of the Ni3N surface. SEM images show that pure",

SEM images show that pure Ni3N adopts a morphology resembling seaweed-like clusters Figure 1c. After modiﬁcation with F ions, vertical nanosheets composed of irregular nanopar- ticles were widely distributed on the entire Ni foam Figure 1d. Transmission electron microscopy TEM images demonstrate that Ni3N, F10-Ni3N, and F15-Ni3N are exclusively composed of nanoparticles Figure 1e,f; Figure S3, Supporting Information. The particle size distributions conform to a narrow Gaussian pro- ﬁle, with over 85 of the particles falling within the size ranges of 75150 nm for Ni3N, 75250 nm for F10-Ni3N, and F15-Ni3N, respectively. Notably, the broader size distribution observed in the F-doped variants, particularly F10-Ni3N and F15-Ni3N, sug- gests that the incorporation of F ions signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the growth kinetics of Ni3N, thereby promoting controlled particle coarsening and facilitating the development of larger nanopar- ticles. Moreover, the corresponding element mapping by EDX undoubtedly conﬁrms the homogeneous distribution of Ni, N, and F elements in the ﬂuorinated product, indicating that F is uniformly presented on the Ni3N surface Figure 1g, Figure S4. Additionally, the high-resolution TEM HRTEM images of Ni3N Figure 1h, F10-Ni3N Figure 1ij and F15-Ni3N Figure 1k in- dicate that the lattice spacing of the plane is 0.214, 0.203 nm, which agrees well with the spacing of the 002, and 111 planes of Ni3N.7c To investigate the surface valence states and local micro- environment of catalysts, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS measurements were further carried out. The Ni 2p core level spectrum exhibits two pairs of spin-orbit peaks with binding en- ergies at 852.7, 855.9 eV, as well as two shake-up satellite peaks Figure 2a.16 As seen in the XPS spectrum of Ni 2p, there is a positive shift of 0.1 and 0.2 eV for the Ni 2p peak in the F10-Ni3N and F15-Ni3N compared to that in Ni3N. This demon- strates the electron density delocalization around Ni atoms in the F-modiﬁed Ni3N, due to the stronger electronegativity of F com- pared to N.

This is consistent with the Ni 2p characteristic peaks of reported Ni3N. Furthermore, the Ni 2p peak position at 852.7 eV shifts negatively due to the removal of F ions from the Ni3N surface Figure 2b. Additionally,Figure 2c exhibits the N 1s spectrum of Ni3N, where the two main peaks at 397.7 and 399.0 eV can be assigned to the metal-N bond N-H group, respectively.17 As the F modiﬁcation content further increases, F ions may aggregate to form F-rich regions on the Ni3N surface or within its lattice, potentially leading to the formation of F-enriched domains. The emergence of these regions can induce a redistribution of elec- tron density, whereby N atoms may experience enhanced electron shielding from neighboring Ni or F atoms. This altered electronic environment consequently results in a reduction of the N 1s bind- ing energy. Moreover, to identify the local micro-environment of Adv.

These phenomena collectively indicate that the F ions are more prone to bond at the surface of Ni3N than in the bulk. The X-ray absorption near edge structure XANES results inset in Figure 2e conﬁrm that F10-Ni3N exhibits a slightly higher ox- idation state compared to Ni3N, corroborating the ﬁndings from the XPS analysis. Notably, the pre-edge intensity of the white line, which corresponds to the electronic transitions18 is observed to be marginally elevated in F10-Ni3N compared to pristine Ni3N. This subtle yet signiﬁcant enhancement points to a profound al- teration in the electronic structure of the Ni3N species. Such a modiﬁcation is likely attributable to the pronounced interactions between ﬂuorine and Ni3N, which may induce a redistribution of electronic states and modulate the local coordination environ- ment of the nickel centers. In addition to the comparison of surface F content before and after Ar sputtering, supplementary DFT calculations further cor- roborate the ﬁnding that F ions are prone to occupy the surface sites of Ni3N rather than substituting N sites. The position for F integration in Ni3N was investigated by calculating the forma- tion of energy Eform of substitution or adsorption Figure 2f. Adv.

Surface diﬀerential charge density maps reveal that F-modiﬁed Ni3N surfaces exhibit a more pronounced electron-deﬁcient state Figure 2g,h, as more electrons from surface Ni atoms are trans- ferred to F atoms. This electronic redistribution is expected to modulate the subsequent electrocatalytic performance. In addi- tion, the natural bonding of F-Ni bonds has been unraveled by the ELF.19 A high value of ELF 0.8 is a signature of the strong covalent character of Ni-F bonding Figure 2i. For a deeper in- sight into the inﬂuence of electronic interactions at the hetero- junction interface, the partial density of states for the F ion was examined Figure 2j.

This interaction enhances catalytic activity by acting as eﬀective promoters, a topic that will be discussed in the following sections. 2.2. Electrocatalytic Performance Toward the HER The alkaline HER catalytic performances of F-modiﬁed Ni3N nanosheet catalysts with diﬀerent F contents are evaluated in a standard three-electrode conﬁguration system. Figure 3a shows the linear sweep voltammetry LSV curves of F-modiﬁed cata- lysts with diﬀerent F contents without iR-correction. The over- potential of F10-Ni3N 78 mV to obtain 10 mA cm2 presents the best electrocatalytic performance among the studied sam- ples, verifying that suitable F content modiﬁcation acts as a key role in optimizing the HER catalytic performance. More- over, the Tafel plot reveals the reaction kinetics and the rate- controlling step in the HER process. In Figure 3b the Tafel slope of F10-Ni3N is only 117 mV dec1, smaller than that of F15-Ni3N 136 mV dec1 and pristine Ni3N 162 mV dec1. This sug- gests that the catalytic reaction happened through the combined Volmer-Tafel mechanisms21 and the catalytic reaction kinetics are greatly improved after F ions modiﬁcation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy EIS is also conducted to investigate the eﬀects of F ions modiﬁcation on the interfacial charge transfer kinetics during the HER process. F10-Ni3N exhibits the small- est charge transfer resistance among all the studied electrocat- alysts Figure 3c; Table S3, Supporting Information, implying the fastest charge transfer rate at the interface of electrode and electrolyte. The electrochemical double-layer capacitance Cdl is a key parameter to reﬂect the electrochemically active surface area ECSA and intrinsic catalytic activity of catalysts Figure S6, Supporting Information. As shown in Figure 3d, the Cdl of F10-Ni3N 42.9 mF cm2 signiﬁcantly outperforms that of Ni3N 31.7 mF cm2 and F15-Ni3N 32.8 mF cm2. This indicates that ﬂuorine modiﬁcation optimizes the density of active sites, thereby promoting the HER. Additionally, ECSA-normalized LSV curves have been performed Figure S7, Supporting Informa- tion, which show that F10-Ni3N maintains the best HER catalytic performance. Therefore, the improvement of HER catalytic eﬃ- ciency performance is not entirely caused by the increase in spe- ciﬁc surface area. The electrochemical stability of the electrocata- lysts is evaluated via the amperometric i-t curve test. In Figure 3e, F10-Ni3N is found to have superior catalytic stability at a ﬁxed po- tential of 80 mV vs. RHE over 40 h. Based on the above re- sults, the increased active sites and accelerated water dissociation dynamics of Ni3N caused by F ions modiﬁcation synergistically contribute to its higher HER activity. F10-Ni3N demonstrates su- perior performance compared to nickel-based catalysts, as shown in Table S4 Supporting Information. To gain a deeper comprehension",

F10-Ni3N demonstrates su- perior performance compared to nickel-based catalysts, as shown in Table S4 Supporting Information. To gain a deeper comprehension of ﬂuorines role, it is es- sential to unravel various factors that could impact HER in the current system. In the case of F ion modiﬁed Ni3N, the elec- tronic state of the Ni site should be altered by the strong elec- tronic interactions between Ni3N and F ions, which was fur- ther studied by DFT calculations. Ni3N 001-terminated sur- face with the relatively lower surface energy was chosen based on the computed surface phase diagrams as a function of ele- mental chemical potentials in previous work.7c,9 Since the cat- alysts performance is determined by the chemical environment of surface F ions that directly engage with reactant species, the optimal ﬂuorine adsorption energy ΔEF structure was cho- sen as the simulation structure Figures S8S10, Supporting Information. The ΔGH of F ion modiﬁed Ni3N and pristine Ni3N were sys- tematically studied. The ΔGH is increased from 0.62 eV at hol- low sites of Ni3N to 0.45 eV at F-top sites of F10-Ni3N Figure 3f, indicating the kinetics for the subsequent H2 generation are boosted consequently. Moreover, the occupation of F ions at sur- face sites not only adjusts the electronic structure of hollow sites but also initiates the lifting of ΔGH at hollow sites distant from the F ions, which positively inﬂuences proton desorption at active sites. Since the hollow sites far away from N atoms with stronger ΔGH 0.62 eV restrict the HER dynamics severely due to the accumulation of electrons Figure S11, Supporting Information, it is necessary to unveil the eﬀects of ﬂuorine on the electronic structures of F10-Ni3N. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of the high catalytic activity of F10-Ni3N, we performed the partial density of state DOS and surface electron density diﬀerence plot. The d-band center 𝜖d of Ni3N and F-modiﬁed Ni3N relative to the Fermi level Ef was calculated to be 0.03 and 0.11 eV Figure 3g, which demonstrates the 𝜖d is far away from the Fermi level af- ter F modulation. This suggests the antibonding energy states are decreased, and the interaction between the adsorbate and the surface is weakened.22 Considering the hydrogen adsorption on the hollow sites of the Ni3N surface is too strong to boost the HER, the incorporation of F modulates the electronic structure by attenuating electron accumulation in the dx2-y2 and dxy orbitals of Ni atoms, thereby optimizing the electron distribution across the surface Figure S12, Supporting Information. This electronic modulation facilitates enhanced HER kinetics. Note that the HER in alkaline media requires an additional ﬁrst step of water ad- sorption; the adsorption energy of a water molecule ΔEH2O on the Ni3N and F10-Ni3N surfaces was further calculated. F10-Ni3N displays a slightly higher water adsorption energy 0.60 eV compared with pristine",

Consequently, the deple- tion of electron densities at the F z-direction could potentially of- fer active sites for proton desorption. Taken together, all the elec- tronic structures analysis and ΔGH results consistently suggest that the occupation of surface inactive sites by F ions eﬀectively modulates the electron densities and the position of the 𝜖d of sur- face Ni atoms for proton adsorption and improve the HER activity of F10-Ni3N as shown in the illustration Figure 3i. 2.3. Electrocatalytic Performance Toward the MOR To elucidate the essential role F ions in MOR process, an ad- ditional electrocatalytic performance of precatalysts was per- formed.

Supporting Information. Speciﬁcally, F10-Ni3N requires a po- tential of 1.43 V to drive a current density of 100 mA cm2 when catalyzing MOR in 1.0 M KOH with 1.0 M methanol, neg- atively shifting by 240 mV compared to that of OER Figure S15, Supporting Information. Meanwhile, the Tafel slopes of F10-Ni3N and F15-Ni3N are remarkably low, measuring 36.2 and 31.9 mV dec1, respectively. These values are substantially lower than those of pristine Ni3N 54.2 mV dec1 and NiOH2 81.3 mV dec1, underscoring a signiﬁcant enhancement in reaction kinetics for the MOR. This pronounced reduction in Tafel slope highlights the pivotal role of F ion incorporation in modulating the electronic structure of active sites, thereby fa- cilitating accelerated charge transfer and improved catalytic ef- ﬁciency. It is obvious from Figure 3c that F10-Ni3N manifests Cdl with a much higher value of 16.6 mF cm2 than those of F15-Ni3N 12.5 mF cm2, Ni3N 10.9 mF cm2, and NiOH2 1.9 mF cm2, providing substantial evidence for the proposition that F incorporation introduces more active sites for the MOR. The anodic product was identiﬁed as exclusively formate via 1H NMR and ion chromatography, underscoring the high selectiv- ity of the F10-Ni3N for MOR Figures S16 and S17, Supporting Information.

It was observed that Ni3N has faster surface reconstruction kinetics compared to NiOH2 in methanol electrolyte, as evidenced by the signiﬁcantly reduced high-frequency phase angle. Concurrently, F10-Ni3N exhibited a markedly lower phase angle compared to catalyst Ni3N at the high frequency region, with surface F ions further accelerating the sur- face reconstruction dynamics. The low frequency 101100 Hz region of the bode plot is generally considered to nonhomogeneous charge distribution,25 namely the formation of intermediate species on the electrode surface. An apparent peak in Figure 4d,e is found in the low- frequency region at the potential of 1.35 V for Ni3N and F10-Ni3N in the methanol electrolyte, which consistently shows a lower on- set potential compared with that in the KOH electrolyte 1.5 V, Figure S18a,b, Supporting Information. The peak frequency sig- niﬁcantly shifts toward a higher frequency region 10 Hz when the voltage increases to 1.35 V and the phase angle decreases with the presence of F modiﬁcation at the surface Figure 4e. This phenomenon indicates F ion modiﬁcation accelerates the kinet- ics of the electrochemical oxidation of methanol molecules. Re- markably, interfacial charge transfer kinetics of F10-Ni3N at 1.40 V demonstrate that the F10-Ni3N possesses the lower electrooxi- dation resistance Ro, 0.28 Ω and electron-transfer resistance Rct,1.96 Ω in the MOR process than that of the control sample Figure S19, Table S5, Supporting Information. Figure S20 Sup- porting Information demonstrates that F10-Ni3N exhibits excel- lent stability over a prolonged 110-h MOR test. The post-MOR morphology remains largely intact, albeit with increased surface roughness, as shown in Figure S21 Supporting Information. These observations suggest that the F modiﬁcation accelerates the dissociation kinetics of MOR and boosts the electrooxida- tion of the intermediates to formate. Noteworthily, the F10-Ni3N demonstrates a superior MOR electrochemical activity compared to state-of-the-art nickel-based catalysts Table S6, Supporting Information. Additionally, to investigate the practical application potential of F10-Ni3N catalyst, we incorporated the KOH-containing elec- trolyte into a two-electrode undivided cell for MOR and water electrolysis Figure 4f. Linear sweep voltammetry LSV curves showed that as-synthesized F10-Ni3N in 1.0 M KOH with 1.0 M methanol electrolyte reached 20 mA cm2 only needs 1.50 V cell voltage, which is far less than that of water electrolysis system 1.68 V and could be maintained at 1.66 V cell volt- age working for 168 h Figure S22, Supporting Information.

Steady-state polarization measurements were conducted at stepped current densities ranging from 50 to 500 mA cm2, with the corresponding cell voltages recorded Figure 4g. Remarkably, F10-Ni3N achieved a cell voltage of 2.02 V at 200 mA cm2 during the MOR, representing a 12.6 re- duction compared to the conventional OER 2.31 V.

Notably, when benchmarked against other nickel-based non-precious metal cat- alysts, F10-Ni3N exhibited outstanding electrochemical activity and durability, underscoring its potential as a highly eﬃcient and robust electrocatalyst for energy conversion applications Table S7, Supporting Information. Taken together, this strategy en- ables the co-production of H2 gas and value-added formate at a quasi-industrial scale in both membrane and membraneless elec- trolyzer systems. Additionally, repeated voltage onoﬀtests, facil- itated by electrolyte replacement, demonstrate that the F10-Ni3N- based electrochemical methanol-to-hydrogen coupling system is capable of eﬃciently storing and converting intermittent energy. These ﬁndings further support the conclusion that F10-Ni3N is a highly eﬃcient bifunctional catalyst for industrial applications. 2.4. Active Phase and Surface Reconstruction Dynamics of Catalysts in MOR For a more comprehensive understanding of the catalysts sur- face reconstruction process and identiﬁcation of the actual ac- tive components, detailed structural, chemical, and valence in- formation was obtained using a combination of methods, in- cluding amperometric i-t curve analysis, postmortem HRTEM, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and ex situ XPS measurements. First, the surface dynamic reconstruction process of catalysts has been systematically investigated. The inconsistent durabil- ity performances of NiOH2, Ni3N, and F10-Ni3N at a constant potential indicate that the precatalysts surfaces undergo a fast dynamic change under alkaline methanol oxidation conditions Figure S23, Supporting Information. Speciﬁcally, at 1.40 V, The F10-Ni3N requires a shorter time 0.5 h to achieve surface re- construction than that of Ni3N 6 h and NiOH2 larger than 10 h. Additionally, a reliable electrochemical steady state of F10- Ni3N was achieved with the aid of F ions leaching Figure S23c, Supporting Information. This phenomenon will be elaborated in the subsequent section. After 0.5 h of reconstruction, compared with Ni3N 12.2 mA cm2, Figure S24, Supporting Information, the elevated current density diﬀerence jafter 0.5 h activation- jinitial observed in F10-Ni3N 24.4 mA cm2, signiﬁes that F expedites the surface restructuring process of the catalyst. The corresponding TEM image shows a discontinued amor- phous layer 2 nm at the Ni3N edge regions, while the lattice fringe of 0.204 nm in the core structure can be attributed to the 111 plane of Ni3N, which",

When the voltage is below 1.45 V, the inten- sity ratio of I𝛿𝜈of F10-Ni3N is in good agreement with the values of 1.6 reported for 𝛽-NiOOH.27 In Figure S28a Supporting In- formation, a distinct red-shift of Raman peaks, particularly the 𝛿Ni-O mode at 470 cm1, is observed for F10-Ni3N with in- creasing potential. This shift indicates that a small fraction of 𝛽- NiOOH undergoes deprotonation, transforming into 𝛾-NiOOH as the applied voltage increases.28 While the value of I𝛿𝜈for the F10-Ni3N catalyst shows as high as 2.02.2 over the potential of 1.50 V, which indicates that the surface reconstructed phase un- derwent a partial transition from 𝛽-NiOOH to 𝛾-NiOOH and is also consistent with Bodes diagram Figure S28b, Supporting Information.29 The valence states of the active phase during electrocatalysis were monitored by ex-situ XPS. Fluorine 1s spectrum for the F10- Ni3N catalyst at 1.351.40 V displayed a couple of peaks located at 684.5 and 688.7 eV that could be assigned to F-Ni and F-covalent, respectively Figure S29, Supporting Information. The emerg- ing F-covalent bonds could be attributed to the F ions coordinated with the surface-active phase.30 Nevertheless, when the poten- tial reached 1.40 V and higher, the F signal vanished, which is consistent with previous results that the surface reconstruction process is accompanied by F ions leaching Figure S29, Support- ing Information. The ratio of Ni3 valance state in Ni3N in MOR increased faster with applied potential 1.45 V along with the decreased percentage of Ni, demonstrating the surface Ni3N re- constructed to NiOOH deeply Figure 5c, Figure S30, Supporting Information. Moreover, the negative shifted Ni3 binding energy 1.40 V could be subjected to the F leaching, causing the local- ized electrons near the Ni atoms. To probe the atomic coordination environment of the recon- structed catalysts active phase, in situ XANES at the Ni-K edge and post-edge XAS at the O-K edge were performed Figure S31, Supporting Information. The data show a progressive Ni-K ab- sorption edge shift toward higher energies with increasing ap- plied potential, signifying an elevated oxidation state of Ni Figure 5d. Notably, the absorption edge of F10-Ni3N shows a signiﬁ- cantly greater positive shift compared to Ni3N under identical potentials Figure 5e, suggesting that F10-Ni3N is more prone to deprotonation and subsequent reconstruction into high valence Ni oxide species. Considering the time-resolution scale of 1 h in in situ XAFS characterizations, surface F ions are prone to loss under a potential of 1.60 V. Consequently, the partial doping of F",

Considering the time-resolution scale of 1 h in in situ XAFS characterizations, surface F ions are prone to loss under a potential of 1.60 V. Consequently, the partial doping of F ions within the bulk phase likely facilitates surface reconstruc- tion through accelerating electronic conductivity. Moreover, in O- K XAS spectra Figure 5f, the ﬁrst feature a corresponds to the pre-peak, attributed to transitions from O 1s electrons to an- tibonding O 2p states hybridized with Ni 3d orbitals, primarily localized at Ni sites. At higher energies, two prominent features b and c are observed, which can be attributed to medium- and long-range structural contributions. Compared to the active phase of Ni3N, the F10-Ni3N catalyst ex- hibits a reduced O-Metal intensity, indicative of increased struc- tural disorder at extended distances.31 Moreover, variations in the relative intensities of features b and c reﬂect a diminished local coordination environment around O atoms. This suggests that ﬂuorine incorporation promotes the reconstruction of the active phase into a short-range-ordered, loosely packed structure with enhanced local disorder.32 These ﬁndings highlight the role of F in tailoring the active phases structural and electronic properties. Considering the surface reconstruction of NiOH2, Ni3N, and F10-Ni3N into high-valence NiOOH, a conclusion previously val- idated for NiOH2 in our prior study, the key distinction lies in the core-phase composition within the reconstructed core-shell structures. Notably, the three materials display distinct electrical conductivities, with Ni3N and F10-Ni3N exhibiting metallic be- havior, whereas NiOH2 manifests characteristic semiconduct- ing properties. Speciﬁcally, F10-Ni3N is distinguished by a higher density of electronic states near the Ef compared to Ni3N, indica- tive of enhanced charge carrier availability Figure S32, Support- ing Information. Furthermore, in the context of the MOR, the electrochemical oxidation resistance follows the trend F10-Ni3N Ni3N NiOH2. This observation allows us to infer a corre- sponding hierarchy in conductivity, which aligns as F10-Ni3N Ni3N NiOH2, underscoring the pivotal role of electronic struc- ture in dictating electrocatalytic performance. Based on this anal- ysis, the F10-Ni3N core structure serves as an eﬃcient electron- transfer bridge between the matrix and the active center Figure 5g, thereby exhibiting superior surface reconstruction capability compared to Ni3N and NiOH2. 2.5. F Ion Accelerating Surface Reconstruction and Methanol Dissociation Mechanism Based on the preceeding in situ Raman and in situ EIS analyses, it has been conclusively demonstrated that the dynamic recon- struction process entails the oxidation of Ni metal sites. Concur- rently, the elevation of Ni valence states is invariably coupled with the deprotonation of the active phase.29,33 To further elucidate the mechanism of ion dissolution and adsorption, we evaluated the dissolution behavior of Ni ions from various catalysts under a constant potential of 1.4 V. Results from inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy unequivocally conﬁrmed the occurrence of Ni dissolution during the electrocatalytic pro- cess. Notably, the F10-Ni3N catalyst exhibited a signiﬁcantly lower Ni dissolution rate compared to pristine Ni3N, underscoring",

In summary, the dynamic reconstruction process is characterized by a mul- tifaceted interplay of metal site oxidation, dissolution, and re- adsorption of metal ions, and hydroxyl deprotonation. Then, a key question remains: how do the surface F ions signiﬁcantly boost the reconstruction dynamic of F10-Ni3N? Here, the eﬀect of F ions on the thermodynamics of divalent nickel species, 𝛽- NiOOH, and 𝛾-NiOOH growth process was further revealed by DFT calculation. The adsorption process of OH- on the Ni3N surface is likely to be a key event for the next surface reconstruction reactions. First, a signiﬁcant oxidation peak area in the potential range of 0.81.05 V versus RHE in the CV curves can be observed, suggest- ing the OHis prone to adsorb at the F10-Ni3N surface than that of Ni3N Figure S34, Supporting Information. Besides, F10-Ni3N also shows much more strong OHadsorption energy 0.60, 0.16, and 0.49 eV than that of pure Ni3N 0.31, 0.35, and 0.42 eV at catalysis surface Figure 6a; Figure S35, Support- ing Information, which also is consistent with the Zata potential Adv.

It is noteworthy that the strong electronic interaction be- tween F ions and the of surface-coordinated Ni atoms of Ni3N will be weakened due to the upshifts of F ions energy level, con- sequently leading to the concurrent leaching of ﬂuoride ions dur- ing the dynamic reconstruction process Figure S37, Supporting Information. Moreover, the ability to adsorb Ni ions and OH near the electrochemical interface is strengthened in the F incor- porated 𝛽𝛾-NiOOH. The introduction of ﬂuorine plays a dual role in the reconstruction process. F ions not only act as an OH promoter to boost the adsorption of OH1.68 vs 1.79 eV, Figure S38a, Supporting Information adjacent to the edge sites of 𝛽- NiOOH but also accelerate Ni ions adsorption 0.82 vs 1.87 eV, Figure S38b, Supporting Information. This consistent trend of F modiﬁcation is also evident in the 𝛾-NiOOH phase Figure 6b; Figure S39, Supporting Information, making it energetically fa- vorable to establish a NiOOHNiO2 structure at the surface when compared to the OH-modiﬁed 𝛾-NiOOH. Making it energet- ically favorable to form NiOOHNiO2 structure at the surface compared to that of OH modiﬁed 𝛾-NiOOH. It is important to note that the reconstruction process is typically accompanied by the deprotonation of surface-adsorbed hydroxide ions, leading ul- timately to the formation of the active phase. Therefore, we also investigated the inﬂuence of F ions on this process. DFT results indicate that F ions thermodynamically promote the deprotona- tion steps in both 𝛽-NiOOH 2.85 vs 2.96 eV and 𝛾-NiOOH 1.98 vs 2.22 eV, thus accelerating the generation of the active phase Figures S40 and S41, Supporting Information. Combined with the above experimental and theoretical results, a schematic diagram of the F accelerates surface reconstruction mechanism is given Figure 6c. In an alkaline electrolyte, the surface F ions promote the electrocatalyst to adsorb OHto form OH, making the surface appear divalent. For this oxidation pro- cess, two possible oxidation pathways are proposed here schemed as Figure 6d: 1 the applied potential drives Ni atoms to lose elec- trons and adsorb OHleading to the formation of Ni2𝛿NOHads, 2 the dissolved Ni2 near the catalyst surface will combine with OHto form NiOH2. These two possible pathways lead to the formation of Ni2 compounds. As working potential increases, strong OH- adsorption brings about a phase transition to Ni oxyhydroxide. In this process, F ions act as an OH-and Ni ions promoter, which boosts the adsorption of OHand Ni ions ad- jacent to the edge sites of 𝛽-NiOOH. Here, the residual Ni2 re- constructs into amorphous Ni3N𝛽-NiOOH heterojunctions with high-valence states. Moreover, with a higher degree of polariza- tion charging, the formed metastable nickel hydroxide evolves into the 𝛾-NiOOH",

Here, the residual Ni2 re- constructs into amorphous Ni3N𝛽-NiOOH heterojunctions with high-valence states. Moreover, with a higher degree of polariza- tion charging, the formed metastable nickel hydroxide evolves into the 𝛾-NiOOH phase with a lattice expansion owing to K and water molecules inserting. In this process, F ions simultane- ously facilitate the adsorption of both OHions and nickel ions, thereby accelerating surface reconstruction. Meanwhile, the pres- ence of F ions in the bulk phase facilitates electron transfer from the catalyst to the electrode, thereby accelerating the surface re- construction of Ni3N. In summary, the synergistic modulation of electrons and ions by F ions both at the surface and in the bulk phase collectively promotes the catalysts surface reconstruc- tion. Moreover, DFT calculations elucidate that the previously ob- served lower dissolution rate of Ni2 ions into the electrolyte for the F10-Ni3N phase, relative to pristine Ni3N, originates from the presence of F ions, which markedly enhances the adsorption of Ni2 ions on distinct catalytically active surface sites, thereby mit- igating their dissolution. To elucidate the reaction pathway and discern the interme- diates formed during the reaction, in situ ATR-FTIR measure- ments were carried out. Upon an increase in bias potential to 1.40 V, distinct spectral features emerged, signifying critical de- velopments at the reaction initiation Figure 6e. These newly observed bands are ascribed to speciﬁc vibrational modes: the vasCOO vibration mode at 1581 cm1, the 𝛿CH vibration mode at 1381 cm1, and the 𝜈sCOO vibration mode characteristic of formate at 1353 cm1.34 Signiﬁcantly, any discernible in- frared signals were absent within the 17502200 cm1 range, thus establishing that formate formation transpires without fur- ther deprotonation to produce CO species Figure S42, Support- ing Information.6a Consequently, the proposed mechanism for the dissociation of methanol into formate proceeds through a four-step process, consistent with both the in situ ATR-FTIR re- sults and prior research:5e methanol adsorption, dehydrogena- tion, formation of CHO intermediate, and coupling with OH to generate formate. DFT calculations with the explicit solvent model K and water in the NiO2 layer are also further performed to better understand the dehydrogenation activation pathway of methanol at the sur- face of 𝛾-NiOOH. We compare both pathways with either C-H or O-H activation in the ﬁrst step of the reaction. The O-H ac- tivation of methanol, as well as the subsequent C-H activation of methoxy to formyl, takes place over the top of a single metal atom, as shown in Figure 6f. Methanol molecular dehydrogena- tion at Ni surface sites involves the primary activation of the O-H bond, followed by the activation of the C-H bond. The subsequent coupling of CHO with OHrequires overcoming a thermody- namic energy barrier of 2.40 eV. Thus, the observed thermody- namic energy barrier for the MOR reveals that the CHO cou- pling with OHis a potential determination step.

Moreover, the C-H activation, identiﬁed as the primary elementary step, was in- vestigated on the surface Ni4 site originally Ni3. This process yields CH2O and H, with H adsorbing onto lattice oxygen, sig- niﬁcantly lowering the thermodynamic energy barrierdownhill by 2.51 eV compared with primary CH3O-H dissociation, which demonstrates that lattice oxygen participates in and accelerates the C-H activation thermodynamics Figure 6f. However, it re- quires a much larger barrier of 1.72 eV to catalyze the subse- quent lattice O-H bond breaking. This indicates that thermody- namically C-H cleavage as primary activation step is energetically unfavorable. 3. Conclusion In summary, we successfully developed aﬀordable F ions modi- ﬁed Ni3N electrocatalysts through a facile hydrothermal and nitri- dation approach. The surface of nickel nitride modiﬁed by F ions exhibits excellent performance for both H2 evolution and MOR. Adv.

Moreover, the thermodynamics of the conversion of methanol into formate on the reconstructed surface of F10-Ni3N materials was revealed that methanol dehydrogenation carries out primary O-H bond activa- tion and the secondary CH bond activation steps at surface Ni sites. By studying the eﬀect of adsorbed F ions on the oxidation of methanol on Ni3N, we deduce that the adsorbed F ions enhance the surface self-reconstruction process by altering the binding en- ergy between the surface active phases and solutes OH, Ni2. Lastly, the intriguing modiﬁcations of the catalysts surface by ionic interactions, as induced by F ions adsorption, may hold fundamental and mechanistic implications for the broader ﬁeld of electrocatalysis. The electrocatalytic systems examined in this article might serve as the inaugural example of such innovative catalytic enhancement.

Recently, electrochemical nitrate NO3 reduction under acidic conditions has received considerable attention but it suffers from limited efﬁciency especially under low NO3concentration. Here, we report an in situ formed positively charged polyethyleneimine-modiﬁed Cu under acidic conditions as a catalyst-electrolyte interface CEI for electrochemical NO3reduction to NH3. Such CEI can effectively accumulate NO3anions via static interactions and accelerate NO hydrogenation to NOH by weakening NO intermediate adsorption on Cu site, thereby facilitating NO3-to-NH3 conversion. Such CEI delivers an increased NH3 Faradaic efﬁciency FE of 83.5 and an impressive half- cell energy efﬁciency EE of 37.1 in 10 mM NO3solution pH 1. The NH3 FE and EE can further increase to 90.2 and 44.1 in 0.5 M NO3, respectively. The high EE of CEI surpasses previously reported catalyst performances for NO3reduction. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of a novel NO3-furfural battery, showcasing a self-power electrocatalytic system capable of simultaneously treating NO3pollutants, generating value-added NH3 and upgrading biomass. This work offers valuable insights into the construction of a CEI to enhance the efﬁciency of NH3 synthesis. Ammonia NH3, the pivotal feedstock for producing arti- ﬁcial fertilizers and a carbon-free energy carrier, is essential in contemporary society.1,2 Currently, the global demand for NH3 exceeds 150 million tons per year, predominantly met through the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process, which operates under harsh conditions of high pressure 200350 atm and temperature 400C600 C, consuming approximately 12 of global energy and contributing to 1.4 of global carbon emissions.3,4 In light of escalating environmental concerns, extensive research is underway to investigate alternative and environmentally sustainable pathways for NH3 production.5,6 Recent endeavours have focused on the electrochemical reduction of N2 to NH3, drawing inspiration from the natural microbial dinitrogen N2 ﬁxation process.6,7 However, the inherent challenges associated with the robust NN bond 941 kJ mol1 and the poor solubility of N2 in water limit the NH3 yield rate to less than 10 mmol gcat1 h1, with partial current densities falling below 1 mA cm2. These limitations impede the widespread use of this approach. Alternatively, nitrate NO3 shows a much lower dissociation energy of 204 kJ mol1 for the NO bond, rendering it an attractive nitrogen source for NH3 electrosynthesis.8 Also, NO3is commonly found in industrial wastewater and polluted groundwater, contributing to eutrophication and ecosystem disruption.9 Thus, the selective NO3reduction reaction NO3RR provides an attractive approach for NH3 synthesis to address energy and environmental crises simultaneously. Despite signiﬁcant progress in catalyst development with consistently improving efﬁciencies in neutral or alkaline electrolytes, the electrochemical NO3RR under acid condi- tions remains relatively rare.10 Nevertheless, acidic NO3- containing wastewater is prevalent in many industrial pro- cesses such as mining, metallurgy and petrochemicals.11,12 Hence,",

In reality, many nitrate sources, such as textile industrial wastewater, exhibit low NO3concentrations.13 Consequently, achieving electrochemical low-concentration NO3RR is particularly challenging, given the substantial decrease in Faradaic efﬁciency FE when NO3concentra- tions fall below 10 mM.14 This decrease primarily stems from the planar symmetrical resonant structure of NO3, which results in low binding afﬁnity and nucleophilicity, coupled with the complicated eight-electron, nine-proton transfer process required for NO3-to-NH3 conversion and kineti- cally competitive hydrogen evolution reaction HER.15,16 Furthermore, the negative electric ﬁeld generated by the negatively charged cathode intrinsically hinders the accumu- lation of NO3anions to the interface, where the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged cathode and NO3 anions impedes NO3diffusion,17 leading to low NO3 concentration near the electrode surface Figure 1a.

While several strategies, including nanomicro-conﬁnement and con- struction of internal electric ﬁelds,18,19 have demonstrated success in promoting low-concentration NO3RR, signiﬁcant challenges persist in enhancing the selectivity of NO3RR towards NH3. A potential strategy to address these challenges involves immobilizing cations on the surface of electrocata- lysts to manipulate the inner Helmholtz layer. This approach can reduce the negative charge on the catalyst at the potential required for reducing the anionic reactant, resulting in NO3 accumulation near the surface of the cathode, as illustrated in Figure 1b. This strategy holds promise for enhancing the efﬁciency of NH3 synthesis during NO3RR. In this study, we develop a catalyst-electrolyte interface CEI comprising Cu catalyst modiﬁed with an in situ formed positively charged polyethyleneimine PEI under acidic conditions for electrochemical NO3-to-NH3 conversion, demonstrating high efﬁciency. Theoretical analysis indicates that the in situ formed positively charged CEI effectively attracts NO3anions through static interactions near the catalyst surface and weakens interactions between the Cu and NO intermediates, thereby facilitating NO3reduction towards NH3 synthesis. The resulting CEI shows energy- efﬁcient performance for acidic NO3-to-NH3 conversion, achieving the best half-cell energy efﬁciency EE of 37.1 and FE of 83.5 for NH3 formation in 10 mM NO3 pH 1.

The CEI also demonstrates practical potential as an advanced cathode material for a NO3-furfural battery, enabling simultaneous NO3degradation into NH3, biomass upgrading and energy output. We chose Cu catalyst modiﬁed with the PEI layer as demonstration considering that Cu has been extensively explored as an electrocatalyst for NO3RR and many amino groups in PEI molecular chains can be in situ positively charged under acidic conditions owing to the high pKa of PEI.20,21 Density functional theory DFT calculations elucidate the spontaneous protonation of abundant amino groups in PEI, which serve as active positive-charged sites attracting NO3anions via static interactions. As shown in Figure 1c, the protonation of different amino groups on PEI, namely NH3, NH2 and NH, is thermodynamically favourable. The NH3 group exhibits the highest propensity for protonation with a formation energy of 0.64 eV, followed closely by NH2 with a reaction energy of 0.61 eV, and NH with a formation energy of 0.36 eV. Consequently, all three types of amino groups can thermodynamically undergo protonation, altering the charge distribution behavior of the inner Helmholtz plane at the CEI.

It shows that the densities of NO3anions are uniformly distributed from the electrolyte to the Cu 111 surface, indicating a weak attraction of the Cu 111 surface towards NO3anions Figure 1f. Interestingly, we observed a signif- icant increase in the relative density of NO3anions at the positively charged CEI relative to the bulk electrolyte. This clearly demonstrates the positively charged CEI facilitates the accumulation of NO3. MD simulations also reveal substantial densities of protons occurring at the CEI interface, which were absent in the pure Cu system. These observations demonstrate that the in-situ formed positive-charged CEI can effectively manipulate the negative charge distribution of the inner Helmholtz plane and increase the concentration of NO3via static interactions, thereby conducive to the superior NO3-to-NH3 conversion. Furthermore, the PEI layer itself is electron-insulating, mitigating the adverse effects of the negative electric ﬁeld of the pure Cu cathode on the diffusion barrier of NO3from the electrolyte to the Cu 111 surface, resulting in increased NO3densities at the interface. To understand the NO3RR mechanisms after introducing the PEI chains, the corresponding Gibbs free energy proﬁles of CEI and Cu were calculated based on the pathway NO3 NO3 NO2 NO NOH NHOH NH NH2 NH3 NH3 g, which is the most probable for Cu 111 in previous literature.22 As shown in Figure 1g, it is clear that the introduction of PEI could effectively change the adsorption free energy of different N-containing intermediates. The rate-limiting step of the NO3reduction reaction was identiﬁed as the hydrogenation of NO to NOH. This step incurs a signiﬁcantly higher energy cost on the Cu 111 surface, with a reaction energy of 1.82 eV, compared to as low as 0.80 eV on CEI. This discrepancy may stem from the strong binding of NO at the hollow site on the Cu 111 surface, as indicated by the signiﬁcant charge transfer between NO and the Cu site Figure 1h. This lowers the energy level of the NO state. In contrast, the NO intermediate adsorbs on the Cu site and interacts with the -NH2 group on the PEI. Considerable s-p orbital interactions occur between -NH2 and the oxygen atom of NO, reducing the charge interactions between NO and Cu and weakening NO binding to the Cu surface Figure 1i. Consequently, the energy level of the NO state is elevated. As a result, less energy is required for NO hydrogenation on the CEI, imparting greater activity to the CEI than the pure Cu. All these observations demonstrate that the CEI can effectively enrich the NO3densities at the interface under acidic conditions and further weaken the strong adsorption of NO of Cu catalyst, thereby fascinating the overall NO3 conversion to",

All these observations demonstrate that the CEI can effectively enrich the NO3densities at the interface under acidic conditions and further weaken the strong adsorption of NO of Cu catalyst, thereby fascinating the overall NO3 conversion to NH3. As proof of concept, Cu and CEI nanostructures were ﬁrst synthesized through a facile electrodeposition method refer to the Methods in Supporting Information for details. Both the X-ray diffraction XRD patterns of Cu and CEI exhibit identical peaks characteristic of face-centred cubic Cu Figure S1. Furthermore, when electrodeposited onto Ti foil, both Cu catalysts displayed diffraction peaks corresponding to Cu JCPDS No. 031018 along with those of the Ti sheet JCPDS No. 441294 Figure S1b, afﬁrming the successful deposition of Cu. No diffraction peaks for PEI can be observed due to its amorphous structure Figure S1c. From the scanning electron microscopy SEM of Cu and CEI, it is clear that the addition of PEI leads to the formation of smaller and more uniform nanoparticles Figure S2. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy HRTEM images of the Cu and CEI nanoparticles disclosed crystalline planes with a lattice spacing of 0.208 nm, attributed to the 111 facets of the metallic Cu phase Figure S3. Nevertheless, a mottled contrast is evident in the images of CEI, suggesting the possible presence of defects. To ascertain the incorporation of PEI, scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy STEM-EDS was carried out. As depicted in Figure 2a,b, Cu and N are uniformly distributed on CEI Figure 2a, while no N signal is detected for Cu Figure 2b. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS spectra were utilized to probe the chemical states of Cu and CEI. The peaks at 399.0, 400.0 and 400.9 eV in N1s spectra of CEI can be assigned to NH2, NH and NH2NH3 groups of PEI Figure 2c, respectively.23,24 The peak observed at 933.2 eV in Figure 2d closely aligns with the binding energies of the Cu0 element of CEI.25 Meanwhile, the peak at 935.4 eV is attributed to the Cu2 element, indicative of surface oxidation of Cu likely due to exposure to ambient air.26 After etching the CEI surface for 5 nm, the Cu2 signal signiﬁcantly decreases Figure S4. Compared to Cu, the peak for Cu0 in CEI shifts to a higher binding energy, suggesting an interaction between Cu and PEI. This shift implies electron transfer from Cu to the adjacent PEI, rendering the Cu centers more electron-deﬁcient and enhancing the adsorption of NO3. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy FTIR of CEI was conducted to conﬁrm PEIs presence further.

Additionally, the NHx peak undergoes a discernible shift to the lower frequency region post-immersion in the acidic solution due to the hydrogen bonds among protonated PEI moieties.33 This phenomenon is substantiated by the Zeta potential values Figure 2f, revealing a positively charged PEI layer on the surface of Cu nanoparticles. Notably, bare Cu exhibits Zeta potentials close to 0 at both pH 1 and pH 7, whereas PEI-containing nanoparticles manifest positive charges at the same pH values. This observation suggests the introduction of a positive charge to the catalyst through the protonation of amine functional groups in the acidic medium. Such a charge modiﬁcation mitigates the repulsion between the catalyst and NO3during the NO3RR. Moreover, treating CEI in a 0.05 M H2SO4 solution and subsequently immersing it in a 1 mM KOH solution results in a decrease in the pH value of the NaOH solution Figure 2g. This phenomenon underscores the neutralization of the positively charged CEI in alkaline media, thereby afﬁrming the in situ formation of the positively charged CEI under acidic conditions. The cumulative evidence points toward the in situ generation of CEI featuring a positively charged layer.

This distinctive attribute facilitates the accumulation of NO3and may play an important role in promoting proton transfer and reaction kinetics during the NO3RR, thus enhancing the performance of the catalyst for acidic NO3-to-NH3 conversion. The electrochemical performance of Cu and CEI was then examined under ambient conditions within a standard three- electrode conﬁguration. Figure 3a presents the linear sweep voltammetry LSV curves of electrochemical NO3RR in an electrolyte with and without 10 mM NO3pH 1. Cu and CEI show poor HER activity with ultralow current density until the negative polarization reaches 0.2 V. Upon introducing 10 mM NO3, the onset potential shifted positively to 0.2 V for Cu, while CEI displays a higher current density than Cu, implying enhanced NO3RR activity facilitated by PEI. To validate the LSV results, FE and yield rate of major products at various potentials were quantiﬁed, employing standard curves for NH3, N2H4, NO3and NO2in Figures S5 and S6. Notably, N2H4 was not detected at any potential for both Cu and CEI Figure S7, and only a small amount of NO2 FE 5 was observed for Cu and CEI at the potentials before 0 V Figure S8. Figure 3b illustrates that both Cu and CEI exhibited a similar trend in FE of NH3 at different potentials, peaking initially with an increase in potential and subsequently decreasing at higher overpotentials. Speciﬁcally, CEI achieves the higher FE maximum of NH3 83.5 at a more positive potential 0 V compared to the Cu electrode 64.9 at 0.1 V, underscoring the superior catalytic activity of CEI over bare Cu. The yield rates of NH3 presented in Figure S9 further substantiate the signiﬁcantly enhanced activity and selectivity of CEI compared to Cu. Figure 3c depicts the concentration changes of NO3and NH3 in the electrolytes. CEI nearly converted 10 mM NO3to NH3 within 200 min at 0.2 V. Moreover, the electrochemical Angew. Chem. Int.

NO3RR performance of Cu and CEI was tested at a higher NO3concentration of 0.5 M. Figure 3d shows the LSV curves of Cu and CEI in 0.5 M NO3pH 1. CEI exhibits a more positive onset potential 0.3 V and higher current density than Cu, demonstrating its superior NO3RR catalytic activity in terms of NH3 selectivity and yield rate of NH3 at each applied potential Figures 3e and S10, S11. The maximum NH3 FE 90.2 for CEI is found at 0.1 V, higher than 72.3 for bare Cu at 0 V. The positive potentials and high NH3 FE of CEI make the half-cell EE of NH3 up to 44.1 at 0.2 V Figure 3f. Remarkably, this half-cell NH3 EE for CEI 37.1 and 44.1 at 10 mM and 0.5 M NO3, respectively surpasses those reported for other recent electrocatalysts at both high and low NO3concentrations Figure 3g and Table S1. All these electrochemical observations demonstrate that CEI shows enhanced electrochemical NO3-to-NH3 conversion performance across a wide range of NO3concentrations. The electrochemically active surface area ECSA was also estimated based on double-layer capacitance Cdl.3436 As shown in Figure S12ac, CEI shows a larger Cdl of 14.3 mF cm2, higher than that for Cu 12.4 mF cm2, indicative of a greater exposed active surface area for NO3RR. The intrinsic activity of Cu and CEI was further assessed by normalizing the ECSA. As shown in Figure S12d, CEI still exhibits higher activity than Cu, highlighting the distinguished intrinsic activity of CEI for NO3RR. To investigate the effect of Cu2 on electrochemical NO3RR, the CEI surface was ﬁrst etched for 2 nm to enable the peak area ratio of Cu2Cu close to that for the Cu sample Figure S13. Then, the NO3RR activity of after-etching CEI catalyst was tested at 0.1, 0, and 0.1 V. As shown in Figure S14, the NH3 yield and FE of CEI before and after etching are almost the same, suggesting that Cu2 shows little impact on the NO3RR under acidic conditions. To estimate the electrochemical durability of CEI, we per- formed long-term electrolysis at 0 V versus RHE. Figure 3h shows the chronoamperometric curve, revealing only a slight decrease in current density at a constant potential. Continu- ous electrolysis for 16 h demonstrates a nearly linear increase in NH3 concentration in the electrolyte with minimal changes in NH3 FE, indicative of the high electrochemical stability of CEI. After electrolysis, the nanoparticle morphology of CEI can be well preserved, and the 111-faceted lattice fringes of copper are observed Figure S15a,b.

As shown in Figure S17a, only about 46.5 Cu in the CEI is dissolved into the solution after 1-h electrolysis at different potentials due to the inevitable corrosion and dissolution of catalyst materials under acidic conditions.12 With prolonged electrolysis time for 24 h at 0.1 V, about 0.76 Cu in the CEI is dissolved in electrolyte Figure S17b, suggesting the exhibited metal dissolvation at a reduction potential and high stability of CEI under acidic conditions. It is worth noting that the protonation of PEI to form the CEI is reversible. CEI after washing with water and drying in a vacuum oven shows an N-H signal. After re- immersion in acid, the -NH2 signal appears, indicating the reversible protonation of PEI to form the CEI Figure S18a. The regenerated CEI also shows good stability, maintaining a high NH3 FE and yields for six cycles Figure S18b. To further understand the NO3RR kinetics on both Cu and CEI, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy EIS was conducted at the open-circuit potentials under various tem- peratures Figure 4a, followed by an in-depth distribution of relaxation times DRT analysis, which offers a nuanced understanding of the primary electrochemical processes.37,38 Figure 4b reveals a predominant peak spanning from 102 to 1 s, corresponding to the charge transfer resistance Rct on the cathodes.39 At 298 K, CEI shows a lower resistance for the charge transfer than Cu, signifying accelerated kinetics for NO3RR on CEI.

Subsequent ﬁtting of the Rct peaks according to the classic Arrhenius law facilitates the determination of activation energies for each interfacial charge transfer process ERct, as illustrated in Figure 4c. Relative to Cu ERct 35.4 kJ mol1, the CEI displays a reduced charge transfer energy barrier of 27.6 kJ mol1. This reduction is attributed to the introduction of PEI on the Cu surface, a modiﬁcation that fosters the direct hydrogenation of NO3to NH3 under acidic conditions. In situ FTIR spectroscopic measurement provides insight into the molecular-level mechanism of NO3RR and the detection of adsorbed reaction intermediates. Potential- dependent transmittance spectra of Cu and CEI are presented in Figure 4dg. Both Cu and CEI catalysts show similar peaks at 1230, 1384, 1640, 3077 and 3650 cm1 assigned to the formation of NO2, NO3, NOH2O, NH2 and NH, respectively,12,4042 indicative of these two catalysts follow the similar NO3RR pathway under acidic conditions. The spectrum for Cu displays similar peaks to CEI. Cu sample shows higher NO3 intensity than that for CEI. When the potential is more negative than 0.1 V, the NO3 intensity on the Cu sample decreases, which may be ascribed to competitive HER. Besides, Cu shows a higher intensity for Angew. Chem. Int.

Notably, the NH3 signal exhibits the highest intensity among the ﬁve species, indicating it is the main product during NO3RR. The low intensity of NO2 suggests the high selectivity of CEI for NO3RR towards NH3, aligning with the low NO2FE of CEI. The high intensity for NO implies its signiﬁcance as an intermediate in the process, which agrees with the DFT calculation and in situ FTIR spectra. Finally, to ascertain the nitrogen source of the detected NH3, a 1H nuclear magnetic resonance NMR test was employed to identify the NH3 generation of CEI with 0.5 M 15NO3or 14NO3.4346 The typical 1H NMR spectra of the electrolyte collected after electrolysis at 0 V show two peaks corresponding to 15NH4 after electrolysis with 15NO3and three peaks related to 14NH4 after electrolysis with 14NO3Figure 4i, conﬁrming that the generated NH3 indeed originates from the NO3RR. Further, considering that metal ions may interfere with the results of the indophenol blue method, 1H NMR spectroscopy was also employed to assess the ammonia concentration. The NH3 concentration was quantiﬁed using a calibration curve based on standard 14NH4Cl and maleic acid as an internal standard Figure S19a,b.

Different from conventional electrolyzer systems entail- ing anodic oxygen evolution reaction OER coupled with cathodic NO3RR, ZnNOxbatteries have emerged as an enticing platform for the simultaneous production of high value-added NH3 and electricity owing to the high theoretical capacity and low redox potential of Zn metal.47,48 However, they confront challenges such as dendrite formation and corrosion. Moreover, the dissolved Zn ions in the electrolyte necessitate additional electricity for recovery. To address these concerns, we proposed a novel electrocatalytic conﬁguration wherein the low overpotential of NO3RR is coupled with the anodic organic oxidation reactions that are thermodynamically favourable and economical. This innovation renders the sustainable production of value- added chemicals. Particularly attractive are catalytic systems utilizing biomass-derived platform chemicals e.g., glucose, furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural as oxidative substrates, owing to the renewable nature of these organic feedstocks.49 Furthermore, generating value-added organic byproducts instead of oxygen maximizes the return on energy investment. Taking furfural electrooxidation as an illustrative example, Cu electrode was prepared as an efﬁcient catalyst to convert furfural to furoic acid at a low potential. The characterizations of the Cu electrode are provided in Figure S20.

Meanwhile, furfuryl alcohol was also detected originating from the non-Faradaic Cannizzaro disproportionation reaction under strong basic conditions. The corrected FE for furoic acid reached approximately 100 at 20, 40 and 60 mA cm2 Figure S22b. All these results collectively underscore the feasibility of self-powered elec- trocatalytic systems, addressing multiple objectives, including value-added NH3 synthesis from NO3, biomass upgrading, and electricity output. In summary, we demonstrate that the protonation of amino groups on PEI is thermodynamically favourable and the in situ formed positively charged CEI can alter the charge distribution behaviour of the inner Helmholtz plane, increasing the concentration of NO3near the surface of the electrocatalyst. DFT calculations further evidence the CEI also raises the energy of the key reaction intermediate NO to reduce the energy barrier of the rate-determining step of NO3RR. Further, the distribution of relaxation times analysis reveals more rapid NO3RR kinetics over the developed CEI structure. As proof of concept, the prepared CEI delivers increased NH3 FE of 83.5 in 10 mM pH 1 and a further 90.2 when NO3increases to 0.5 M NO3. In addition, CEI exhibits the half-cell EE of 44.1 and 37.1 in 10 mM and 0.5 M NO3pH 1, respectively, exceeding reported values of NO3RR catalysts. Taking advantage of the high reduction potential of acidic NO3to NH3 conversion, the assembled acid-alkaline NO3- furfural battery represents a novel transformative system for simultaneously treating NO3pollutants, yielding value- added NH3, upgrading biomass and electricity output. Our results will inspire the use of CEI as an efﬁcient strategy for the further development of NO3RR electrocatalysts, and it may also be effective for other electrocatalytic reactions.

The in-situ generated HBr from substrate oxidation, known to be detrimental to the reaction itself, was perfectly consumed by cathode reduction. Challenges of this process include the difficulty in maintaining the synergy between substrate oxidation and cathode reduction as well as the general incompatibility of a hydrogen bonding catalytic system with the aqueous acidic media. A monophasic system was initially developed, but with little substrate generality. Further analysis of the mechanism and careful optimization allowed the development of a much more general and robust biphasic system that exhibited multiple advantages over chemical oxidation, including broader scope, less waste, milder conditions, and better enantioselectivity. It is also the first demonstration of chiral phosphoric acid catalysis in cooperation with H3PO4 in acidic aqueous media. Introduction Since the pioneering studies by Akiyama and Terada in 2004,1 chiral phosphoric acids CPA have evolved as a family of broadly powerful catalysts for diverse organic reactions.2 They have been employed as effective chiral ligands, hydrogen-bond donors, and sources of chiral counter anions. Their extraordinary ability in achieving outstanding asymmetric induction by weak interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, constitutes the key to success. While the design of sophisticated structures of CPAs contributed significantly to their performance, the choice of suitable reaction media often makes a big difference.",

Their extraordinary ability in achieving outstanding asymmetric induction by weak interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, constitutes the key to success. While the design of sophisticated structures of CPAs contributed significantly to their performance, the choice of suitable reaction media often makes a big difference. CPA-based hydrogen- bonding catalysis is typically implemented in non-polar aprotic solvents to minimize their competing and often detrimental influence. Moreover, other hydrogen-bond donors, such as stronger Brønsted acids, are typically incompatible with CPA catalysis. As a result, it is a formidable challenge to implement CPA-based hydrogen-bonding catalysis in polar protic solvents in the presence of a strong inorganic acid. In the meanwhile, asymmetric electrosynthesis has gained tremendous developments in the past few years.3-7 The conventional use of stoichiometric oxidants and reductants can be potentially replaced by electricity as a greener and more sustainable alternative. However, current success has been mainly in transition metal catalysis domain, which rely on relatively more robust interaction between chiral catalyst and substrate Scheme 1a.3,4 In contrast, asymmetric induction by weak interactions with a chiral organocatalyst in an electrochemical system has met with limited success, partly due to the challenges associated with those unavoidable polar species present in the media, such as electrolytes, that may interfere with the weak but Scheme 1.

Oxidative rearrangement of indoles to spirooxindoles was chosen as a model reaction for our study, as it represents an important process that converts readily available substrates to highly valuable complex biologically active molecules.8-10 Although great process has been achieved in the development and application of this process in the past few decades, there still remains very limited success in developing a catalytic enantioselective variant Scheme 1b.

Moreover, previous asymmetric protocols uniformly required the use of stoichiometric chemical oxidants.9,10 In this context, the advantages of electrosynthesis further inspired us to develop a greener and more sustainable approach by electrochemical oxidation. Results and Discussion It has been well-known that electrochemical oxidation of Br can be employed to replace chemical oxidants, such as Br2.3,7,11,12 To prove the feasibility of green oxidation approach, we first examined this enantioselective process with stoichiometric Br2 as oxidant and mixed THFH2O as solvent to mimic the electrochemical condition Scheme 2. With A1 structure shown in Table 1 as the catalyst, the reaction of 1a successfully generated the desired product 2a in quantitative yield, but with essentially no enantioselectivity, no matter with Br2 or its analogue nBu4NBr3 entries 12. We also tried slow addition of oxidant, but with no significant improvement entry 3. Next, a control experiment in the absence of A1 showed similar results, suggesting a strong background reaction that might explain the low enantiocontrol entry 4. From the proposed mechanism of this process,10 it is clear that two equivalents of HBr can be generated from this system, which may outcompete CPA to facilitate this process and cause low enantiocontrol. We were also curious about the absence of such dramatic influence of HI generated from the use of NIS in the chemical oxidation protocol.10 Indeed, control experiment indicated that NIS could oxidize HI into I2, thus avoiding the influence of the generated HI see the SI for details. Nevertheless, despite the discouraging chemical oxidation results, we reasoned that an electrochemical oxidation system may fix the problem caused by the generated acid HBr, as the anodic oxidation is accompanied by cathodic reduction, which converts H to H2 and thus neutralizes the reaction system Scheme 2, blue box. To test this hypothesis, we did preliminary study using electricity as oxidant. Gratifyingly, the enantioselectivity was significantly enhanced 73 ee, entry 5. A control reaction by the addition of two equivalents of HBr to this system led to almost complete loss of enantiocontrol entry 6, thus consistent with the above analysis on the influence of HBr in the chemical oxidation. Overall, the preliminary study clearly highlighted the advantage of electrochemical system for this process by synergizing the two half reactions in electrodes. The above preliminary outcome using A1 as catalyst, nBu4NBr as both electrolyte and mediator, and THFH2O as solvent was used as a starting point for further optimization Table 1, entry 1.

With the optimized protocol, we started to explore the reaction scope. However, to our surprise, this protocol was not general at all. For example, variation of the electronic properties on the indole ring had a drastic influence on reactivity. Substrates 1h and 1k showed completely no reactivity under the above conditions Scheme 3. We reasoned that this might be due to unbalanced synergy between substrate oxidation and cathodic reduction. In the ideal situation, the indole oxidation should not be slower than cathodic reduction krxn kred, thus the whole system is slightly acidic and the generated HBr is reduced in cathode.

Consequently, to maintain electron balance, water would be reduced instead, which generates hydroxide OH and turns the system into alkaline. The generated hydroxide not only quenches the CPA catalyst, but also further causes consumption of Br2 by forming BrO, which shuts down the indole oxidation. In principle, such an issue might be alleviated by adjusting the current. However, it is tedious to tune these parameters for each substrate. Thus, a more general protocol applicable to all the substrates would be highly desirable. Scheme 3. Preliminary examination of substrate generality and analysis. We envisioned that a biphasic system allowing physical separation of the indole oxidation and cathodic reduction might be a possible solution to the above issue Table 2. We then employed a mixture of DCM and H2O as solvent. NaBr was chosen as a source of bromide and electrolyte as well, since it has a good solubility in aqueous phase. Unfortunately, the results were irreproducible entry 1, suggesting partial water reduction in the cathode might be still involved to cause an unstable pH value of the system. In this context, we reasoned that the addition of an external acid should ensure an acidic medium, despite its possible interference with CPA in asymmetric induction. Thus, various Brønsted acids of different strengths were examined, including weak acid AcOH and strong inorganic acids HCl, H2SO4, and H3PO4. Among them, HCl and H2SO4 showed neither obvious improvement nor negative effect entries 23. However, AcOH was able to improve the enantioselectivity 93 ee, but with almost no increase in yield entry 4. To our delight, H3PO4 proved superior, resulting in both excellent yield and enantioselectivity entry 5. Moreover, the results were reproducible, with either one or two equivalents of loading entry 6. We believe that the ability of H3PO4, together with its conjugate bases, to serve as a potential buffer to stabilize the acidity of the reaction system might contribute to its extraordinary performance. Furthermore, to briefly test the generality, 1h and 1k were subjected to this new protocol. Both resulted in excellent efficiency and enantioselectivity entries 78, thereby illustrating improved generality of this biphasic binary acid system. It is also worth noting that, to the best of our knowledge, the combined use of CPA and H3PO4 for effective enantioselective catalysis has not been demonstrated before.2 Table 2.

With the newly optimized biphasic protocol, we next examined a wide range of different indole substrates for the enantioselective electrochemical oxidative rearrangement Scheme 4. These reactions were smoothly enlarged to 0.3-mmol scale, along with a higher electric current of 9 mA. Different protecting groups on the nitrogen of the tetrahydro-β-carbolines, such as Boc, Fmoc, Cbz, Bz, and Ts, were all well-tolerated under the mild conditions 2a2e. Moreover, various substituents at different 4- to 7- positions of the indole ring, including both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing ones, all led to excellent outcomes 2f2p. It is worth noting that simple deprotection of 2h could generate the natural alkaloid horsfiline with ease.13 This electrochemical system has a number of advantages over our previously reported chemical oxidation protocol.10 Other than the use of green electricity, the new conditions showed a broader substrates scope. For example, substrates bearing a C4- or C7-substituent e.g., 2f, 2o2p were unsuccessful before, but they reacted smoothly to provide the desired products with excellent enantioselectivity and efficiency under the present electrochemical system. Moreover, tetrahydrofuranyl-sprooxindole 2q, representing another important family of substructures,14 could also be easily synthesized with high enantiopurity. In contrast, such molecules were obtained with sub-optimal enantiocontrol under the previous chemical oxidation system.10 Of note, the previous chemical oxidation system strictly required careful operation at low temperature to achieve high enantioselectivity, but the new electrochemical condition worked efficiently at ambient temperature. Finally, the monophasic system could also be applied to indoles without ring fusion in the 2,3-positions, leading to the corresponding oxindoles 2r2u bearing a non-spiro all- carbon quaternary stereocenter.15 However, a 2-aryl-substituted indole may form the 3-brominated imine product, which was unreactive toward further rearrangement see more details in the SI. Importantly, a gram-scale synthesis of 2h with a reduced catalyst loading resulted in equally high yield and enantioselectivity, illustrating the practicability of this electrochemical process.

In the monophasic system, substrate 1a showed higher oxidation potential than nBu4NBr, suggesting the indole oxidation was performed indirectly by the in-situ generated oxidant from bromide Figure 1a. Upon mixing with 1a, the solution of nBu4NBr exhibited a catalytic current, suggesting consumption of the intermediary oxidant e.g., Br2 by reacting with 1a. For the biphasic system, we examined the effect of additives Figure 1b. The addition of H3PO4 had no influence on the cyclic voltammetry curve of NaBr. In contrast, the addition of NaOH caused an obvious change featuring a higher oxidation current, which might be due to the consumption of the generated Br2 by NaOH. Control experiments were also performed to probe the role of bromide Figure 1c. Replacing NaBr with NaNO3, an alternative electrolyte, led to no reaction. However, the addition of a catalytic amount of NaBr to this system restored the reactivity. These observations implied that NaBr not only served as an electrolyte, but also a mediator, which was consistent with our proposed mechanism involving Br2 as oxidant. Notably, increasing the NaBr concentration did not lead to further improvement see more details in the SI. Then we investigated the role of H3PO4. Two electrolysis reactions of 1a were performed in parallel, with and without H3PO4, under otherwise identical standard conditions Figure 1d. In the absence of H3PO4, the pH value of the aqueous phase increased obviously over time. In the meanwhile, the product enantioselectivity was mediocre and unstable. In contrast, with H3PO4, the same reaction showed almost constant pH value. resulting the inferior and unstable enantioselectivity. While in the presence of H3PO4, the pH value of the aqueous phase remained almost no change before reaction completion. Moreover, the product ee value was also constant and excellent. These observations undoubtedly confirmed the role of H3PO4 as a buffer to stabilize the acidity of the reaction system, which was crucial to the excellent outcome.16 Based on the above results, a possible mechanism is proposed Figure 1e. The reaction begins by anodic oxidation of the bromide in the aqueous phase. The resulting Br2 enters the organic phase to oxidize the substrate with the CPA",

Mechanistic studies. Conclusion In summary, we have developed the first catalytic enantioselective electrochemical oxidative rearrangement of indoles, leading to green and efficient synthesis of diverse highly enantioenriched spirooxindoles. The synergy between indole oxidation and cathode reduction proved critical to the success. The in-situ generated HBr from oxidative rearrangement proved to be detrimental to the reaction itself, but it can be perfectly consumed by cathode reduction. However, the initially developed monophasic system could not maintain this delicate balance of reaction rates, thus lacking generality. Nevertheless, careful mechanism analysis and condition optimization led to a successful improvement into a much more general biphasic 10.1002anie.202510078 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

This new protocol exhibited multiple advantages over the previous chemical oxidation approach, including less waste, broader scope, and milder conditions. The choice of H3PO4 as an additive not only ensured good reproducibility and robustness of this protocol but also improved the chemical efficiency and enantioselectivity. This is also the first demonstration of CPA catalysis in cooperation with H3PO4 in aqueous media. The unusual enhancement in performance by H3PO4 could be explained by the formation of a hypothetical heterodimer with CPA. Mechanistic and control experiments confirmed that NaBr served as both electrolyte and mediator. The development of other organocatalytic enantioselective electrosynthesis methods by weak interactions is ongoing in our laboratories.

Here, we resolve this conundrum by identifying a high- valent anionic intermediate as kinetic gatekeepers during the nitrate reduction on a single-atom catalyst by using AIMD simulations under explicit solvation and electrode potentials. Employing our self-developed constant-potential thermodynamic integration method, we reveal a stark kinetic barrier dichotomy: while the reaction is thermodynamically favorable governed by the NO break, the protonation to oxygen at a low anionic state necessitates substantial activation energy. Mechanistic analysis uncovers that electrode polarization preactivates NO3 into a metastable high-valent NO3 2 intermediate, which serves as the key step to the following protonation process. Crucially, this intermediates stabilization requires a highly negative potential, directly linking its formation to the observed overpotential. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations also demonstrate that K cations play a key role in electrostatically stabilizing the adsorption of negatively charged NO3 onto the negatively polarized cathode. This work calls for the urgent reconsideration of conventional nitrate reduction mechanisms and the exigency of refined interface design principles for improved nitrate electrocatalysis. INTRODUCTION Since the 1980s, electrochemical nitrate reduction NO3 RR has traditionally been proposed for sewage treatment, facilitating the conversion of nitrate into innocuous nitrogen N2.13 Recently, there has emerged a revitalized interest in NO3 RR, motivated by the goal of producing ammonia NH3 instead.4,5 Therefore, electrochemical nitrate reduction repre- sents a sustainable pathway and a promising route for both water treatment and ammonia generation. The practical applications of NO3 RR in energy and environment, however, face a significant challenge due to its exceptionally high overpotential, despite the thermodynamically favorable path- ways with theoretical equilibrium potentials of 1.17 V vs SHE for N2 and 0.12 V vs SHE for NH3 formation. The universal initial two-electron 2e reduction of nitrate to nitrite is generally identified to be a rate-determining step.68 There are two popular contradictory hypotheses regarding the mechanism of reduction of nitrate to nitrite in the NO3 RR. One genre believes that nitrate reduction begins with a protonation process where NO3 interacts with H in solution to form adsorbed HNO3 at the electrode NO3 H HNO3, which is considered a solution-mediated proton transfer reaction and does not require electron transfer.9,10 Then, the formed HNO3 undergoes a process of protonation and dehydration to produce NO2. However, this does not conform to the common chemical knowledge that HNO3 is a strong electrolyte and would inevitably electrolyze into the proton and nitrate ion. The other representation points out that NO3 first undergoes an oxidative associative adsorption, where NO3 is adsorbed and discharged to form NO3 NO3 NO3 e.7,8,1115 Subsequent reduction and hydrogenation pro- cesses lead to the formation of NO2 or NO2 .

However, the oxidative adsorption is unlikely to proceed at the cathode electrode, where the electroreduction of NO3 is operated.

For example, gaseous H2 and HNO3 are often chosen as reference points for calculating the binding energy of NO3 , as proposed by Calle-Vallejo et al.19 GNO d3 GNO d3 G GHNO d3g 12GH d2g Gcorrect. A large number of DFT calculations based on the CHE model have indicated that the rate-determining step of the transition of nitrate to nitrite is markedly exothermic. However, many catalysts such as Fe NC catalysts exhibit a significant overpotential exceeding 0.6 V.79,11,12,2022 Therefore, current theoretical calculations fail to explain the origin of the high overpotential, strongly suggesting that previously overlooked dynamic processes or complex interface effects may have played a key role. It is only within the past few years that an ever-increasing understanding of dynamically electrified solidliquid interfaces has started to trigger a return to this foundational pillar of electrochemistry, namely, uncovering the roles of electrode potential and solvent in electrochemical reactions under realistic electrochemical conditions,23,24 notably, in the CO2RR,25,26 ORR,27 and NRR.28 Unlike these neutrally charged small molecule reactants like CO2 and N2, NO3 ions are negatively charged in solution, which is expected to result in a significantly different mechanism. Nevertheless, it is fair to acknowledge that no study has yet provided a definitive description of the reduction behavior of NO3 at the electrodeelectrolyte interfaces. Here, we uncover the origin of the high overpotential for NO3 RR on the FeNC catalyst by employing the self- developed constant potential kinetic modeling method. Specifically, the critical roles of electrode potential and cations in the reaction mechanism were revealed. The 2ereduction pathway from nitrate to nitrite is characterized as exothermic thermodynamically, but our calculations show a notable kinetic energy barrier that must be surmounted.

The electrode potential plays its role in accelerating the reaction kinetics by preactivating NO3 to high-valent NO3 2, while K at the interface stabilizes the negatively charged NO3 2by electro- static interactions. Notably, the observed high overpotential is attributed to the highly negative reduction potential required for the conversion of NO3 to NO3 2. Our results highlight the pronounced electrostatic interactions at the electro- chemical interface in stabilizing charged reaction intermediates and provide new mechanism insights into the NO3 reduction process. This work explains the origin of experimentally observed high overpotentials, which cannot be accounted for by traditional models. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The Role of K in Nitrate Adsorption. First, explicit counterion models were constructed to examine the dynamic adsorption of nitrate at the FeN4Cwater interface Figure S4. In the explicit counterions model, different numbers of K atoms were added, which spontaneously convert to hydrated K and charge the electrode surface. In the K-Inter model, K was placed on the side of the adsorbate at the interface Figure 1. Role of K. The FeO distances that vary with the number of cations a; potential-dependent charge on NO3 b; the adsorption energy of NO3 at 0.82 V vs RHE c; and the charge on NO3 during adsorption d.

By contrast, the K-Back model placed the K at about 15 Å away from the interface, and the K and adsorbate were on either side of the slab due to the periodicity of the model, thereby avoiding direct interaction between the K and nitrate. These two models enable a comparison of how cations influence the electrochemical reaction at the interface under varying applied potentials. Each model ran at least 10 ps AIMD simulations to adequately equilibrate, and the density distribution of water and the distribution of K were analyzed from the trajectory at different electrode potentials Figure S5. In the K-Inter model and K-Back model, the distributions of water and K are symmetrical with respect to the electrode surface. An evident first water adsorption peak appears within 24 Å of the surfaces, reaching a maximum density of water of about 2.0 gcm3. After the first layer of water, there is a depletion of water with a minimum density of 0.5 gcm3 at about 5 Å. Further away from the surface, the wave fluctuations of water are gradually suppressed, and the density is recovered with an average value of around 1.0 gcm3. However, the K are distributed dynamically within the range of 26 Å away from the surface of the FeN4C electrode. We then investigated the adsorption behavior of nitrate by collecting bond length and charge in AIMD simulations, as shown in Figure 1. NO3 is adsorbed on the FeN4C catalyst via",

    "text": "However, the K are distributed dynamically within the range of 26 Å away from the surface of the FeN4C electrode. We then investigated the adsorption behavior of nitrate by collecting bond length and charge in AIMD simulations, as shown in Figure 1. NO3 is adsorbed on the FeN4C catalyst via an end-on configuration, in which one O atom of the nitrate binds with the Fe center. It can be observed in Figure 1a that the length of the FeO bond in the K-Back model remains at 2 Å until the number of K ions increase to 5, when it suddenly becomes longer longer than 5 Å. This indicates that NO3 is desorbed due to the electrostatic repulsion with the negatively polarized electrode surface as the number of K increases. By contrast, the FeO bond length in the K-Inter model fluctuates in the range of 23 Å, where the location of nitrate is perturbed by the dynamic distribution of K at the interface. These results demonstrate that the K cations play a crucial stabilizing role in the nitrate anion adsorption process. In the K-Back model, the NO3 species maintains both its monovalent character of 0.85 e and a N O bond length of 1.27 Å across the entire potential window. Notably, a potential-dependent charge accumulation phenom- enon was observed in the K-Inter model. At an electrode potential of around 0.8 V vs RHE, we observed a significant additional charge transfer of about 0.6 e to NO3 Figure 1b, converting to a high-valent NO3 2 anion. This transformation is accompanied by a distinct structural change, as evidenced by the elongation of the average NO bond length from 1.27 to 1.37 Å, indicative of nitrate activation. The stabilized adsorption of the high-valent NO3 2species can be attributed to enhanced electrostatic interactions with neighboring K cations, as confirmed by our electronic structure analysis Figure S6. These findings demonstrate a unique nitrate activation that is specifically enabled by the K-Inter model, highlighting the crucial role of electrostatic interactions in stabilizing nitrate adsorption at the electrified interfaces. Further, our recently developed Constant-Potential Ther- modynamic Integration CPTI method29,30 was employed to calculate the reaction energetics of nitrate adsorption in K- Inter and K-Back models at the electrode potential of 0.82 V. The CPTI method enables realistic modeling of the electrochemical interface, and the efficient free energy calculations are based on a robust surface charge density descriptor. At each collective variable CV chosen along with the reaction pathways, the CPTI method was applied to regulate the total number of electrons of the system to keep the electrode potential constant. By collecting the mean force of constraint at each CV Figure S7 and integrating over the mean force of constraint with respect to the CV, the free energy under fixed potential can be computed. The free energy curves in Figure 1c suggest that the adsorption energy of nitrate is only about 0.1 eV with a negligible energy barrier, which is thermally accessible. Moreover, the location of K hardly changes",

The free energy curves in Figure 1c suggest that the adsorption energy of nitrate is only about 0.1 eV with a negligible energy barrier, which is thermally accessible. Moreover, the location of K hardly changes the adsorption energy of nitrate. Nevertheless, we found a difference in the charged state of the nitrate at adsorption Figure 1d. In both models, the electrode potential is maintained at the preset potential of 0.82 V during the reaction. It is worth noting that in the K-Back model, the charge of nitrate during adsorption is kept at 0.85 e, while in the K-Inter model, nitrate accepts about 0.6 additional electrons during adsorption, transforming from NO3 to NO3 2. This result can be interpreted as a shift of adsorption from physiosorbed NO3 in the K-Back model to chemisorbed and activated NO3 2in the K-Inter model. Thus, all results suggest that the nitrate is adsorbed on the surface of the electrode in the form of anions and emphasize the crucial role of electrostatic stabilization by K in the process of chemical adsorption and activation of NO3 into NO3 2on the FeN4C electrode. Recognizing the pivotal contribution of cations to the reaction mechanism, we focus on the K-Inter model to restore the dynamic behavior of K on the interface in the following discussion. The Mechanism of Nitrate Reduction. In a series of AIMD simulations at different electrode potentials, the dynamic evolution of nitrate reduction from NO3 to NO2 was captured uniquely at the electrode potential of 0.85 V. As displayed in Figure 2a, the evolution of nitrate reduction proceeds where the proton is first transferred to the adsorbed NO3 , followed by dissociation of hydroxide anions, leaving an adsorbed NO2 on the FeN4C electrode surface in a period of several hundred femtoseconds during the AIMD simulations. The change of bond length Figure 2b Figure 2. Evolutions in AIMD simulations. The change of potential energy a and distance b of nitrate reduction from NO3 to NO2 at 0.85 V vs RHE. Journal of the American Chemical Society pubs.acs.orgJACS Article https:doi.org10.1021jacs.5c05728 J. Am. Chem. Soc. XXXX, XXX, XXXXXX C also shows that the HO bond is formed with a bond length of 1.0 Å after proton transfer, subsequently followed by NO bond cleavage from a bond length of 1.3 Å during hydroxide dissociation. At a more positive electrode potential of 0.05 to 0.77 V, NO3 can be stably adsorbed during the simulations without obvious structure evolutions Figure S8. Inspired by this observation, we then employed the CPTI method again to calculate the reaction energetics of nitrate reduction at the representative electrode potentials of 0.55 V and 0.82 V. In order to capture the metastable intermediates, we have chosen two sets of CVs for the proton transfer step and hydroxide dissociation step, respectively, to dissect the 2e reduction reaction of nitrate to nitrite. The free energy diagrams along the reaction pathway are shown in Figure 3,",

Specifically, the proton transfer for NO3 is endothermic with a free energy of 0.92 0.01 eV, while the hydroxide dissociation from NO2OHto NO2 is exothermic with a free energy of 1.59 0.02 eV. The evolution of structures along the reaction pathway in Figure 3b shows that the NO bond of NO3 is 1.29 Å, while the NO bonds are 1.27 and 1.32 Å in NO2 . There is a process of electron transfer required to charge the metastable inter- mediate for subsequent hydroxide dissociation after proton transfer. By contrast, when the electrode potential is reduced to 0.82 V, the energy barrier of the reduction reaction caused by the proton transfer step is greatly reduced to only 0.30 0.01 eV. It is worth emphasizing that prior to the proton transfer step, NO3 has first undergone reduction to NO3 2during adsorption at the electrode potential of 0.82 V, as supported in the previous sections. The protonation of preactivated NO3 2is largely easier to occur kinetically than the direct protonation of NO3 with a reduction of reaction energy of about 0.6 eV. The evolution of structures along the reaction pathway also confirmed the potential-dependent activation of NO3 with a longer NO bond of NO3 2of 1.36 Å at 0.82 V than that at 0.55 V. The results suggest that the activation of nitrate induced by electrode potential determines the further reduction kinetics to nitrite. The regulation of the electrode potential and the total number of electrons added to the system along with the reaction coordinates are displayed in Figure 4. The electrode potentials along the reaction pathways are all within the set convergence threshold centered on 0.55 V and 0.82 V in Figure 4a,c, respectively, during the CPTI simulations. The solid lines show the total number of electrons added to the system during proton transfer blue and hydroxide dissoci- ation sampled as red. It takes about 2 electrons for the reduction reaction from NO3 to NO2 and about 1 electron for the reduction reaction from NO3 2to NO2 . The change in charge on intermediates was also analyzed, which allowed one to consider the following nitrate reduction mechanism. At 0.55 V Figure 4b, during proton transfer blue line, the charge on NO3 and the total charge on NO3 and the transferring proton denoted as NO3 H were collected. With the progress of the reaction, the charge on charged NO3 changes a little, staying about 1e, while the",

With the progress of the reaction, the charge on charged NO3 changes a little, staying about 1e, while the NO3 H remains neutrally charged with about 0.3e. This reveals that the proton transfer for NO3 participates by Figure 3.

During hydroxide dissociation red line, the charge on NO2 and the total charge on NO2 and the dissociating OHdenoted as NO2 OH were collected. With the progress of the reaction, the charge difference of charged NO2 OHand NO2 is increased to 0.7 e. This indicates that the OH species gradually gains an electron and dissociates into solutions as OH. It is worth noting that after the proton transfer and before the hydroxide dissociation, one electron is transferred to form negatively charged NO2OH in the yellow shaded area. At 0.82 V, a similar charge analysis was carried out as shown in Figure 4d, and the following 2ereduction reaction mechanism was hypothesized. NO3 initially obtains the first electron for prereduction to form high-valent NO3 2eq 1; then, NO3 2undergoes the protonation process and subsequently obtains the second electron to dissociate into NO2 and OHeq 2. Detailed charge distribution analysis suggests that the electron accumulation on a specific oxygen atom of the nitrate molecule, as complemented by background charge, drives the dissociation of the OHgroup Figure S10. The density of states DOS was also conducted to show that the arrangement of d orbitals of the Fe center is evolved as the electrode potential decreases to promote the adsorption and activation of nitrate at the active Fe center Figure S11. Thus, the d orbitals of the Fe active center act as a medium for electron transfer, bridging the electrode surface and NO3 . NO e NO 3 3 2 1 NO H O e NO 2OH 3 2 2 2 2 At this stage, the mechanism of the two-electron reduction from NO3 to NO2 has been clearly elucidated. Our calculations indicate that a significant energy barrier must be overcome in the reduction process to nitrite, despite the reaction being thermodynamically exothermic. The crucial intermediate of NO3 2along with the determining step in the reaction pathway has been identified. The 2ereduction of NO3 to form NO2 by direct protonation is kinetically extremely challenging.

Intriguingly, when NO3 is first activated to NO3 2by a reduction step, the subsequent protonation and one-electron reduction processes to form NO2 are significantly facilitated. However, the reduction potential required for the conversion of NO3 to NO3 2is highly negative, accounting for the experimentally observed high overpotential for nitrate reduction. Our calculations reveal that it is a decoupled process where electron transfer precedes proton transfer in the 2ereduction process. That is why the traditional CHE model failed in this system as the model assumes a coupled proton and electron transfer. Consequently, it is indicated that the preactivation of NO3 is the potential- determining step, while the protonation process is the rate- determining step during the 2enitrate reduction. Further- more, the essential role of electrode potential in accelerating reaction kinetics through preactivation of NO3 to NO3 2is highlighted.

We provide a schematic representation of interfacial interactions involved in nitrate reduction in Figure 5a. Within the Helmholtz plane, there are many charged species with ubiquitous electrostatic interactions and dynamic polarization phenomena. Specifically, at the negatively polarized electrode surface, hydrated alkali metal cations, which are commonly used as supporting electrolytes, are expected to partially localize in the Helmholtz plane. This behavior creates a large interfacial potential drop as pictured in Figure 5b, which dominates the occurrence of electrochemical electron transfer ET processes. As the negatively charged NO3 ions migrate into the interfacial Figure 5. Physical picture of electrochemical interface dynamics.

In addition to electrostatic effects, the solvation effect would also play a role in stabilizing the adsorption of charged intermediates Figure S12. When the electrode potential drops to the reduction potential, one electron transfers from the electrode to the nitrate at the interface, converting NO3 into high-valent NO3 2. Under this electrode potential, the electrostatic repulsion between the electrode and NO3 2is strengthened, while the corresponding electrostatic attraction between K and NO3 2is also enhanced, thereby stabilizing the adsorption of NO3 2for subsequent reactions. Once the reduction potential of NO3 to NO3 2is reached, the protonation process becomes kinetically more favorable, allowing the 2ereduction from NO3 to NO2 to proceed efficiently. We reaffirm that the high-valent NO3 2anion predicted in our theoretical study during the two-electron reduction of nitrate is metastable with a very short lifetime. It is anticipated that advanced time-resolved spectroscopic techni- ques may enable its detection in future studies. Strategies such as the cation,31 electrode potential,32 halogen electrolyte,33 and heterostructure34,35 have been proposed to improve the performance of electrocatalytic nitrate reduction. For example, Wen et al.31 found that K can regulate the electrostatic potential distribution and proton transport in the electric double layer, thus enhancing the kinetics for the conversion of NO3 . Moreover, a series of alkali metal ions Li, Na, K were compared, and it was found that due to the smallest radius of K hydrated cations, the effects were more significant in promoting charge transfer and nitrate reduction. Guo et al.32 proposed to unitize electrode potential to control the active siteintermediate interactions to enhance NO reduction reactivity on oxygen vacancy-modified TiO2. These studies support our calculations here that alkali metal cations can promote the adsorption of nitrate ions, highlighting the key regulatory role of the electrochemical interface micro- environment including electrode potential and electrolyte composition in the kinetics of electrocatalytic reduction reactions. Future studies could further discuss the effects of different species of cation. We anticipate that our work will inspire the development of refined interface design principles for improved nitrate electrocatalysis. CONCLUSIONS In this work, a full explicit model combined with constant potential modeling based on density functional theory was employed. Our work resolves a long-standing puzzle of the high overpotential in nitrate reduction by revealing the mechanism with a particular emphasis on the roles of electrode potential and cations. First, NO3 is observed to absorb on the negatively polarized electrode surface as an anionic species. Subsequently, constant potential kinetics calculations indicate that the 2ereduction pathway from nitrate to nitrite is thermodynamically exothermic, yet it encounters a significant reaction energy barrier. Further, the first electron transfer, driven by the electrode potential, activates NO3 to NO3 2 and emerges as the key of 2ereduction of nitrate to nitrite. Importantly, the electrostatic stabilization provided by K is also indispensable for the adsorption of NO3 anions. Due to the highly negative reduction potential for converting NO3 to NO3",

Importantly, the electrostatic stabilization provided by K is also indispensable for the adsorption of NO3 anions. Due to the highly negative reduction potential for converting NO3 to NO3 2, a high overpotential is required experimentally for nitrate reduction. By considering kinetics, which is often overlooked in traditional calculations, as well as the effects of the electrode potential and cations, this work offers critical insights and timely guidance for electrochemical nitrate reduction. Our findings also call for the urgent reexamination of conventional nitrate reduction mechanisms and the exigency of refined interface design principles to advance electrocatalytic performance.

The Γ-point sampling of the Brillouin zone was used due to the large computation cost.44 The NoseHoover thermostat was employed, and the time step was set as 1.0 fs.

Recent breakthroughs in multicomponent molten systems i.e., binary, ternary, and quaternary have shown great potential for effective CH4 pyrolysis at a moderate temperature, opening up exciting possibilities for the industrialization of CH4 pyrolysis. However, the combinatorial complexity of element selection and atomic disorder in molten media, coupled with the limitations of empirical experimentation and conventional computational methods, present great hurdles for multicomponent molten catalysts design. With the development of artificial intelligence and data technology, the data-driven strategy offers a promising alternative to the traditional experimenttheory approach. From this perspective, we expound and emphasize the data- driven approach for enhancing molten media catalysts discovery and advancing the industrialization development of CH4 pyrolysis. We discuss the capacity of this approach to explore the design space along with several data-guided strategies tackling the existing challenges associated with molten catalysts design.

FRONTIER OF MOLTEN CATALYSTS CH4 PYROLYSIS Natural gas, one of the primary global fossil fuel reserves, is abundant and widely employed, playing a significant role in global energy production.1 However, while its direct combus- tion generates vast amounts of energy, this process releases CO2 as a byproduct, contributing negatively to global warming. Thus, a decarbonization of natural gas to hydrogen has always been a pursuit of researchers. As a result, decarbonizing natural gas into hydrogen has long been a focus of scientific research. As an effective pathway of hydrogen H2 production, CH4 pyrolysis can achieve carbon-free clean energy conversion specifically occurring under the temperature, pressure, and catalyst. In the absence of catalysis, full CH4 conversion or dissociation usually requires a high operating temperature or narrow pressure range. Additionally, the reaction mechanism exhibits intricate coupling steps with various branching byproducts that become progressively more complex as the reaction progresses.24 The formation of H2 and carbon is favored at a high reaction temperature e.g., 1200 C, a long residence time for CH4 in the high-temperature reaction zone, and a moderate pressure.5 Catalysts can significantly lower the temperature required for CH4 pyrolysis down to 500800 C in traditional solid catalysts application,6 but in which carbon produced from CH4 pyrolysis often quickly encapsulates solid particles and deactivates catalysts Figure 1A.

MOLTEN CATALYSTS DESIGN DILEMMA FOR CH4 PYROLYSIS Despite the demonstrated capability of molten catalysts in mitigating coke deposition and catalyst deactivation during CH4 pyrolysis, their industrial implementation remains constrained by the high operating temperatures required by the systems currently reported systems. In this context, the primary challenge for the industrialization of CH4 pyrolysis is the development of highly efficient molten catalysts at low temperatures for decreasing heat supply costs. The recent findings on the catalysis of multimetalsnonmetal elements mixing molten media Figure 1A have shown great potential for effective CH4 pyrolysis at a moderate temperature, opening up exciting possibilities for the industrialization of CH4 pyrolysis. Meanwhile, the potential for mixing multiple molten media presents a vast uncharted space beyond the corners of metal nonmetal elemental and chemical compositional diagrams Figure 1C, offering new avenues for the design of high- efficiency catalysts for CH4 cracking. Previous reports on catalyst compositions, particularly molten metal alloys, have shown that they can be highly effective catalysts and heat-transfer media for CH4 pyrolysis. For instance, in 2017, Upham et al. reported that a 27 Ni73 Bi molten alloy achieved 95 CH4 conversion at 1065 C.13 On the basis of this binary alloy, Chen et al. further proposed a high-efficiency ternary molten metal alloy 2.3 Ni 96.4 Bi1.3 Mo, reaching a hydrogen production efficiency of 4.05 mLgmin even at a low temperature of 800 C.14 Although the inclusion of additional elements offers huge opportunities to design catalysts of molten metals, it also introduces significant challenges in experiments and theory. The first one is the difficulty in exploring the effective alloy, mainly due to the large number of metal elements, the complexity of metal alloy combinations, and the diversity of alloy composition proportion. Even if considering only the most used metal elements in the periodic table, this spans a composition space of at least 1050 metal alloy variants, which cannot be managed by experiment by blind trial and error testing due to the high labor-intensiveness and",

Even if considering only the most used metal elements in the periodic table, this spans a composition space of at least 1050 metal alloy variants, which cannot be managed by experiment by blind trial and error testing due to the high labor-intensiveness and the large energy cost. When the space is expanded to other molten media systems, the challenge is even more hard. Additionally, the experimental understanding of the CH4 activation mechanism in molten catalysts is also challenging owing to the scarcity of in situ tools for molten matter. Second, under an extremely molten liquid state, the catalytic activity geometry, active site, and atomic arrangement of molten media catalysts are dynamically evolving, so that the catalytic activity and reaction mechanism in a liquid catalyst cannot be expounded by conventional catalysis theory.15 In catalysis theory, theoretical reactivity markers are routinely estimated for catalytic property and used in the design of a catalyst. While many theoretical works can be found on solid- state catalysts for various applications,1618 research on molten liquid-state media is still in its nascent stages. In a conventional first-principles simulation, although adopted ab initio molecular dynamics AIMD can obtain an amorphous molten state,19,20 this procedure exhibits a great efficiency bottleneck since it is limited by the need for extensive and costly computational validation. It requires the exploration of a thermodynamic equilibrium model under consideration of a large-atomic scale supercell. In a large spanning space of multimetalsnonmetal elements mixing molten media, the limited spatial and temporal simulation scales of first-principles methods pose challenges in the simulation of dynamic evolution and catalytic CH4 processes in molten catalysts design.

THE ROLE OF MOLTEN MEDIA COMPOSITION FOR CH4 PYROLYSIS CH4 pyrolysis is conceptualized as a complex four-step dehydrogenation process, which is an endothermic, thermody- namically constrained, and equilibrium-limited reaction. In a liquid reaction environment, the composition of molten media affects not only the conversion efficiency of CH4 pyrolysis but also the pyrolysis byproduct type. For industrial viability, the production of high-value carbon is also an important concern, being secondary to catalyst efficiency. In a molten catalytic CH4 pyrolysis, the type of carbon byproduct significantly differs from noncatalytic pyrolysis in a gas condition.4,2124 For example, Palmer et al. reported that the gas CH4 decomposition inside gas bubbles results in amorphous carbon materials,22 while",

By adjusting the composition of molten media, CH4 pyrolysis can not only yield these common carbon forms but also facilitate the production of high-value carbon materials, such as graphene and diamond. For example, by adopting molten copper as the medium, we achieved high- quality multilayer a few layers 40 layers graphene preparation via molten Cu-assisted pyrolysis of methane.11 Recently, our group adopted the ionic complexes of the transition metal chloride and realized the efficient pyrolysis of CH4 and achieved one-pot synthesis of 0D carbon black2D graphene carbon materials.23 Ruoff et al.12 reported that diamond can grow in the subsurface of a molten medium composed of gallium, iron, nickel, and silicon at a 1 atm pressure and 1025 C. These works demonstrated that the different molten media dictated distinct carbon atom growth modes, further determining the carbon product structure. Of course, there also exist some other factors i.e., gas bubble diameter profiles, gas bubble rise velocity, reaction rates, temperature, pressure, and gas compositions that influence carbon formation and its structure. However, from the catalytic viewpoint and structureactivity relationship, the composition of molten media can be considered as a key factor in controlling carbon products, thus necessitating the careful selection for desired outcomes. 4. DATA-DRIVEN STRATEGIES OF MOLTEN CATALYSTS DESIGN FOR CH4 PYROLYSIS Along with the development of artificial intelligence AI and data technologies, the data-driven approaches offer a promising alternative to the traditional experimenttheory approach, which can achieve a much more accurate design or prediction for a large amount of component Figure 1D. In the past decade, machine learning ML and its subdomain deep learning have been explosively rising, which can establish mathematical models to analyze data and reveal the relationships and patterns within them, exhibiting great capability in the field of catalyst design26,27 and alloy predictions, especially in the field of high-entropy alloys.28,29 The success of ML mainly lies in its capability to describe complex patterns within multidimensional data sets, offering systematic optimization pathways through iterative learning processes. ML models enable swift identi- fication of the most promising candidates from thousands of potential catalysts, a feat nearly impossible with traditional methods. For molten catalyst systems, specifically, the challenge of navigating vast compositional spaces makes data-driven strategies particularly valuable. These approaches can efficiently map the complex relationships among composition, structure, and catalytic activity while accounting for the unique physics of liquid-state catalysis.

Descriptor-Guided Design. Data-driven approaches contribute to uncovering catalyst design rules that go beyond physical and chemical intuition. At the heart of this advancement lies the descriptor-guided design methodology, which system- atically leverages structureproperty relationships to identify promising catalyst candidates. As illustrated in Figure 2A, this approach enables the rational design of high-performance systems through carefully selected descriptors that capture essential material characteristics.30 The key point of this approach applied to the molten media design for CH4 pyrolysis is to explore the compositioncatalytic relationship, which can be derived from combining experimental data and theoretical calculations. The theoretical simulations mainly based on first-principles calculations that incorporate simplified model systems can capture the critical aspects of complex realistic systems and thus guide the rational design. Currently, a rough first-principles calculation route Figure 2B can be summarized as follows: obtaining an amorphous molten surface by AIMD, adsorbing the reactants, and calculating the activation barrier using kinetics computation methods e.g., the DFT-based nudged-elastic band method.20 According to the existing molten media prototypes and element-related variations, previous experimenttheoretical simulations-based efforts to elucidate CH4 activation mecha- nisms reveal that a charge transfer at the active site influences the CH4 activation energy, showing solute atoms with less negative charge in molten metal alloy systems exhibit higher activity in CH4 decomposition.13 This chargeactivity correlation offers a suitable option for descriptor-guided design. Based on this essential charge descriptor, Kwon et al. designed Zn0.45Bi0.55 molten alloys as a promising catalyst for CH4 pyrolysis, in which the active metal Zn contributes to changing the charge states of base metal Bi, facilitating CH dissociation.31 Some similar designs were made for CuBi20 and Se-doped NiBi32 molten alloys and their change in the Bader charge of the solvent metal Bi obeys such a rule. Recently, we have explored the Bibased binary molten alloy systems to identify two novel descriptors linked to CH4 activation characteristics: i the H binding energy",

Recently, we have explored the Bibased binary molten alloy systems to identify two novel descriptors linked to CH4 activation characteristics: i the H binding energy of the solute metal as an indicator of CH3H affinity; ii the solute diffusivity as a measure of active-site accessibility.33 Based on these descriptors guidance, we further designed two ternary alloys Bi68Ni27Cu5 and Bi68Ni27Mn5 that demonstrated superior performance with more catalytic activity than the binary BiNi alloy, and their superiority was corroborated by the results of experiments.33 However, current theoretical andor experimental descriptors face important limitations. They often fail to fully capture crucial dynamic phenomena such as the motion of the metal atoms and the vibration of the molecules. At high temperatures, atom or molecule vibrational modes of CH4 pyrolysis often become anharmonic, which could affect the accuracy of free energy calculations, including entropic and enthalpic components; thus, there would be need to consider such effects in the DFT calculations. Additionally, high-temperature molten catalysts may exhibit a mixed electronion conductor effect. However, these effects cannot be accurately accounted for in the static DFT modeling. For complex molten systems, the traditional AIMDDFT calculation route seems to be more difficult for obtaining the rationality of amorphous surfaces generated by AIMD with no scientifically robust structural sampling methods or evaluation criteria. Furthermore, the reaction of CH4 activation possibly occurs at various catalytic environments i.e., the mobile bubble interface; the catalytic activity could be affected by multiple interconnected properties such as surface composition, surface energy, surface tension, viscosity, and density. For instance, Scheiblehner et al. reported Ni-promoted molten metal catalysts exampled by Ni-doped NiSn alloys for methane pyrolysis, for which the reason is attributed to its low surface tension and viscosity, which facilitate the formation of smaller bubbles, thereby increasing the gas residence time within the melt.34 This multifaceted nature of molten catalysis for CH4 pyrolysis calls for the development of more comprehensive descriptors capable of capturing the full complexity of multicomponent catalyst systems. The challenge lies in the extensive computational and experimental resources required to explore the vase compositional space of molten catalysts. Traditional approaches relying solely on experimental methods or computationally intensive AIMDDFT calculations become prohibitively expensive and time-consuming when applied to the full range of potential catalyst compositions. These limitations underscore the need for more efficient strategies in descriptor identification and validation. The establishment of descriptor-guided design principles is fundamentally dependent on comprehensive composition- property data sets. ML enables systematic derivation of mathematical relationships within these data sets, facilitating the identification of latent physicochemical descriptors. This methodology begins with the construction of advanced regression or classification models that quantitatively rank catalyst candidates through statistical correlation analyses between identified descriptors and target performance metrics e.g., CH4 conversion efficiency and activation energy minimization. The analysis then progresses to a rigorous prioritization phase, where candidate materials aligned with strongly correlated descriptor-property relationships. This evaluation",

The analysis then progresses to a rigorous prioritization phase, where candidate materials aligned with strongly correlated descriptor-property relationships. This evaluation applies strict statistical criteria, such as maintaining the Pearson correlation coefficient above 0.7 or meeting comparable significance thresholds. To address the common challenge of data scarcity, the methodology incorporates feature engineering strategies. Through iterative multicycle learning with diversified descriptor combinations, the approach progressively distills critical structureproperty determinants. Such a multiparametric optimization framework effectively overcomes the information extraction limitations inherent to sparse experimental data, thereby enabling data-driven discovery of molten salt catalysts for CH4 pyrolysis. Symbolic regression techniques, particularly the sure independence screening and sparsifying operator SISSO methodology,3537 have emerged as powerful tools for establishing structureactivity relationships in catalysis. These data-driven approaches systematically explore nonlinear corre- lations by constructing mathematical descriptors through combinatorial operations on primary feature sets. As demon- strated in a representative study by Andersen et al.,36 SISSO successfully identified a nonlinear descriptor for single-atom catalysts that surpassed traditional scaling relations in predicting adsorption energies, achieving both improved accuracy and enhanced transferability across material systems. The core strength of symbolic regression lies in its ability to perform exhaustive searches through high-dimensional feature spaces generated by mathematical operator combinations, typically implemented via genetic programming or deterministic optimization algorithms. However, two critical challenges ACS Catalysis pubs.acs.orgacscatalysis Perspective https:doi.org10.1021acscatal.5c02415 ACS Catal. 2025, 15, 1100311012 11006 hinder the direct application of these techniques to the molten catalyst design for CH4 pyrolysis. First, the inherent complexity of molten liquid systems introduces additional degrees of freedom in feature selection, particularly regarding dynamic surface reconstruction and transient coordination environ- ments. Second, while symbolic regression excels at identifying optimal feature combinations, the resulting mathematical expressions often lack physical interpretability, a crucial requirement for guiding rational catalyst design. This interpret- ability gap becomes particularly pronounced when dealing with molten catalysts, where the liquid-phase nature introduces nontrivial thermodynamic and kinetic couplings. To address these limitations, we advise a synergistic approach combining sensitivity analysis with domain-specific feature engineering. Systematic sensitivity mapping of regression- derived descriptors can reveal dominant molten system characteristics such as ionic polarizability and metalligand bond fluctuation frequencies. This physical grounding enables the translation of mathematical descriptors into actionable design principles, such as optimizing charge transfer dynamics or tuning liquid-phase coordination symmetry, thereby establish- ing a closed-loop framework for the development of high- performance molten catalysts. 4.2. Generative Model-Guided Design. Considering some existing data sets of available molten media for CH4 pyrolysis, a realistic expectation is to directly sample new compositions with the desired properties. The generative model offered the potential to explore the unknown combination space. This model learns the intrinsic features of existing data set, acquires knowledge related to element combination, and then samples and generates new components based on the learned patterns.

This model learns the intrinsic features of existing data set, acquires knowledge related to element combination, and then samples and generates new components based on the learned patterns. Currently, several techniques i.e., generative adversa- rial network GAN,38 transformers,39 variational autoen- coders,40 and diffusion models41 have been developed to construct generative models. These generative models have been used to instruct multiple materials design research, such as spintronic materials,42 2D materials,43 and high-entropy alloys.44 In general, the generative models require a material encoding method that is compliant with symmetry operations, in which the lattice vectors, elemental species, atomic numbers, and atomic site coordinates are mainly implemented.45,46 However, molten systems present a unique challenge due to their lack of crystalline symmetry, necessitating specialized approaches focused primarily on elemental species generation. Although the reduced complexity of modeling amorphous molten systems is compared to crystalline materials, ensuring the generated materials from a learned distribution fall inside the desired criteria becomes difficult. Thus, the generative framework must be enhanced with additional constraints and fine-tuning mechanisms, specifically tailored to molten catalyst systems. These refinements should incorporate both theoretical understanding of catalytic mech- anisms and experimental insights into structureproperty relationships, ultimately enabling more precise control over the generated catalyst compositions. To illustrate the generative model procedure for generating molten media, a GAN-based simplified flow diagram is illustrated in Figure 2C, in which the generator takes media compositions from the existing experimental and computational data sets as the input and learns their intrinsic features to generate new compositions. The next step then functions as a discriminator for obtaining reasonable compositions. A crucial intermediate step in this process involves systematic element screening through an iterative enumeration method Figure 2D. This process employs multiple physical and chemical criteria to refine the candidate pool. The selection criteria may include fundamental properties such as suitable melting point and boiling point to ensure operational stability, mutual solubility between elements to maintain homogeneous mixing, and strategic difference in electronegativity to promote effective charge transfer between atoms. These filters can reduce the component space of possible molten catalysts and support a high-efficiency learning in the following discriminator step. The primary technical challenge lies in developing a generative model with strong generalization abilities to effectively expedite the discovery of a new molten catalyst system for CH4 pyrolysis. These models must demonstrate sufficient predictive power to justify their computational overheads, ensuring that the efficiency gains from model predictions outweigh the training costs. A well-trained model should capture the training data sets important latent variables and external conditions, serving as a powerful tool for data augmentation. But the current training set cant perform reaction conditions such as temperature and pressure, hindering the generation of ideal model under reaction conditions. To address these limitations, we suggest advancing the field through external-variate training technology and adaptive strategies.

We expect the new research paradigm that involves training the generative model of a molten catalyst for CH4 pyrolysis and using the constructed model to generate candidates for further DFT validation. 4.3. Active Learning-Guided Design. The development of accurate composition-property predictions for CH4 pyrolysis in molten media faces significant challenges due to the limited available data and inherent biases in feature selection. Conven- tional ML approaches often struggle with these constraints, necessitating more sophisticated methodological frameworks. By synthesizing new data points and refining feature selection methods, we can enhance predictive accuracy and reliability. Advanced methodologies, such as active learning, can extract complex patterns from limited data sets, improving our understanding of catalytic methane properties in pyrolysis processes. Active learning has recently emerged as an alternative choice for materials discovery, demonstrating remarkable success across diverse applications.4749 This methodology excels at extracting complex patterns from limited data sets, offering crucial insights into catalytic behavior during pyrolysis processes. For instance, Raabe et al. constructed an active learning strategy to accelerate the design of high-entropy Invar alloys in a practically infinite compositional space based on very sparse data, characterizing 17 new alloys out of millions of possible compositions.48 Similarly, Tran and Ulissi conducted an active learning-guided theoretically automated screening in the huge search space, and proposed 54 alloys and 102 alloys as potential electrocatalysts of CO2 reduction and H2 evolution, respectively.49 These advancements in active learning highlight its potential for revolutionizing material discovery. By employ- ing such an active learning strategy, researchers could efficiently explore vast compositional spaces, identifying promising candidates with minimal prior data in catalytic CH4 pyrolysis. Active learning, constituting a subfield of ML, employs iterative sampling of the design space to enhance model predictions. This approach addresses the inherent limitations of ACS Catalysis pubs.acs.orgacscatalysis Perspective https:doi.org10.1021acscatal.5c02415 ACS Catal. 2025, 15, 1100311012 11007 initial models that inadequately characterize the entire material space while exhibiting significant potential for efficiently navigating vast and complex material systems to discover innovative candidates. A representative active learning frame- work typically integrates Bayesian optimization with surrogate modeling, wherein the model is initially trained on sparse experimental data sets. The surrogate model undergoes iterative refinement through cyclic integration of DFT calculations, thermodynamic simulations, and targeted experimental vali- dation. This creates a dynamic, closed-loop optimization process that progressively improves both prediction accuracy and the models ability to generalize to unexplored materials. Crucially, the methodology achieves an optimal balance between the exploration of uncharted regions and the exploitation of known high-performance areas within the search space. This dual-focused approach proves to be particularly valuable when addressing the critical challenge of reconciling limited experimental data with high-dimensional search domains.

This dual-focused approach proves to be particularly valuable when addressing the critical challenge of reconciling limited experimental data with high-dimensional search domains. These distinctive advantages position active learning as a particularly promising paradigm for accelerating the discovery of molten catalysts for CH4 pyrolysis in ultralarge parameter spaces. As illustrated in Figure 3, adopting an active learning approach, a closed-loop strategy was given for CH4 pyrolysis molten catalyst design, which includes four interconnected steps: database construction, targeted composition generation, physics-informed screening, and experimental verification. The first step involved collecting all data of molten catalysts verified by experiment, performing a statistical data analysis on these data, and removing a portion of them corresponding to the inefficient composition, in order to obtain a preliminary database. This initial database incorporates detailed feature vectors containing both elemental properties i.e., position in the periodic table, electronegativity, valence electron concen- trations, melting and liquids temperatures, heat capacity, atomic radii and volumes, thermal conductivity and diffusivity, heat of fusion and experimental performance metrics i.e., conversion efficiency, activation energy, along with atomic molten information. The second step involves using generative modeling to explore the unknown composition design space by feature engineering of the existing database. It contains two key constituents, encoder and decoder, in which the encoder learns features from the database as the input and the decoder then functions for producing reasonable media compositions given the learned latent representations. This enables the targeted generation of promising new catalyst compositions. Following generation, a two-stage ensemble regression model further investigated the activity of the generated compositions. The initial stage concerns composition-based regression models aiming at fast and large-scale composition inference, while the second stage conducts physics-based quantitiesmetrics vali- dation such as H formation energy, solute metal diffusivity, surface exposure of active metals, surface tension, and so on through AIMDDFT calculations, ensuring theoretical sound- ness of predictions. In the last step, the most promising compositions are selected by a ranking-based policy. The top- ranked candidates underwent thorough experimental testing. Note that, at high temperatures, gas-phase decomposition of CH4 may also become dominant; thus, we suggest a dual-track experimental workflow to isolate molten media-specific catalytic effects from background CH4 gas-phase pyrolysis: i conduct- ing identical pyrolysis experiments in inert reactors without molten media and systematically mapping temperature-depend- ent methane conversion rates under identical flowpressure conditions; ii performing parallel experiments with molten media under identical conditions and identifying the true catalytic data by subtracting the thermal background. The obtained data and results feed back into the database, continuously enriching the database for subsequent iterations. As the iteration repeats and the experimental database continues Figure 3.

This iterative process not only refines the compositions of molten catalysts but also enhances our understanding of their properties and behaviors. The power of this approach lies in its integration of advanced ML techniques with rigorous computational modeling and experimental validation. This synergistic combination enables the efficient exploration of vast compositional spaces while maintaining scientific rigor. The resulting active learning paradigm accelerates catalyst discovery while advancing our fundamental understanding of sustainable energy conversion processes. 5. TOWARD THE INDUSTRIALIZATION OF DATA-DRIVEN CH4 PYROLYSIS The current data-driven approach for molten catalysts in CH4 pyrolysis research primarily stems from the potential to accelerate the discovery and development of multicomponent molten alloy catalysts. This vision can be operationalized through AI-enabled tools and algorithms designed to assist researchers in identifying optimized catalyst compositions and stoichiometric ratios worthy of experimental validation. Under this way, the integrated application of descriptor-based analysis, generative model recognition, and active learning method- ologies aims to recommend high-performance component combinations that transcend chemical intuition or intelligently explore the vast compositional space within alloy systems to guide experimental investigations. It must be emphasized that the prescriptive analytics achieved through the synergy of catalytic data, machine intelligence, and expert knowledge constitute an iterative process that may not yield immediate results. In this data-driven methodology, a forward model is trained on an initial small data set, which feeds to an optimizer to generate experimental recommendations. A set of these recommendations are experimentally validated, and the data generated are used to expand the data set for model retraining, in order to enhance the predictive accuracy of target variables and enable more confident proposals for subsequent experimental iterations. By these steps and more iterations, we can be confident that the catalyst to meet the needs of methane pyrolysis industrialization will be obtained. It should be believed that the data-driven methodology will revolutionize the catalysts research paradigm of CH4 pyrolysis, accelerating the industri- alization of CH4 pyrolysis Figure 4A. Looking ahead, we anticipate that data-driven tools will be deeply integrated into the entire workflow of CH4 pyrolysis catalysis research, accelerating experimental design, empower- ing data analytics, and fostering the emergence of multi- component molten catalysts. This integration will drive data- informed rational design of molten catalysts and provide innovative solutions to address the grand scientific challenge of developing highly efficient, low-consumption catalysts tailored for the industrialization of CH4 pyrolysis. 6.

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK This perspective offers an in-depth exploration of the potential of a data-driven strategy in the development of high-perform- ance molten catalysts for CH4 pyrolysis, highlighting their pivotal role in accelerating the industrialization of this process. The data-driven strategies are becoming increasingly important in the pursuit of efficient molten catalysts, offering a promising path in CH4 pyrolysis research. By leveraging data sets and ML techniques, researchers can use effective descriptors derived from the composition-property relationship, extrapolative sampling, and generating candidate materials in the latent space based on generative models. Additionally, active learning can be used to expand training sets, enabling exploration of the vast combinatorial space of potential elements and combina- tions. This approach significantly reduces both time and costs associated with traditional experimental or computational methods. This strategy enables a more systematic identification of optimal catalyst compositions that deliver high activity and catalytic efficiency for CH4 pyrolysis while minimizing energy inputs. The essence of this perspective centers on the utilization of data-driven techniques within the design of molten alloy Figure 4.

The question of whether these data-driven emerging methodologies, in conjunction with current market demands, will revolutionize the landscape of CH4 pyrolysis research remains an intriguing topic awaiting further exploration. Some outlooks are given as follows: i. Developing ML-Based Molten Catalyst ModelingThis model involves constructing a high-quality training data set that includes molten media data related to possible element-component-pyrolysis methane activity. This task necessitates integrating diverse sources of data, encom- passing experimental data including reaction conditions i.e., high-temperature and high-pressure and reactor parameters, computational data, theoretical models, and domain expertise, to train models capable of capturing the intricate relationships between composition and catalytic property of molten media. The data must be collected and managed efficiently for the use in model training. The language models LLMs such as GPT,55 DeepSeek56 hold promise for playing a pivotal role in accelerating data acquisition. Their advanced natural language processing and text mining capabilities facilitate efficient navigation and extraction of relevant information from scientific literature. To ensure the reliability of data from LLMs, we can implement consensus-based verification workflows where multiple LLMs independently process the same data sources. Discrepancies between outputs will automatically trigger human expert review, creating a safety net for critical parameters. Additionally, the development of an experimental database, e.g., the recently emerging Digital Catalysis Platform DigCat,57 www.digcat.org, is expected to play an essential role in providing high-volume and",

Developing Self-Driven Platform for Data Acquisition In addition to data availability concerns, more exper- imental validation of ML tasks would help establish the utility of these approaches in a molten environment as well as provide insight into the performance of the model. This reality can be accelerated through the utility of some schemes i.e., widespread experimental researcher partic- ipation in scientific data commons initiatives, developing auto high-throughput experiments, standardization of the characterization of relevant properties data. Through an automation of experimental workflows and autonomous data-driven planning agents system, a self-data-driven platform can be enabled for catalyst design and CH4 pyrolysis testing Figure 4B, in which the extending accumulation of experimental data would facilitate the data learning optimization and comprehensively enhance the overall efficiency of data-driven CH4 pyrolysis catalysis research, significantly accelerating research progress. iii. Advancing Multiscale and ML Force Field Approaches for Molten SimulationsAnother important challenge is related to the realistic molten simulation of CH4 pyrolysis. Although the first-principles calculation method men- tioned above can roughly simulate the microscopic process of CH4 pyrolysis, the nonintrinsic risk of its obtained data needs to update current approaches and develop new route to push the boundaries of simulating down further to real reaction. At high temperatures, molecule or atom vibrational modes of CH4 pyrolysis often become anharmonic. To consider such effects in the accounted DFT simulation, a promising approach is to develop temperature-dependent effective potential to systematically capture anharmonic contributions by iteratively refining interatomic force constants from AIMD trajectories. Along this direction, further efforts are required to develop multiscale calculation methods for simulating the realistic molten catalysis data. In particular, the development and application of an ML force field MLFF, also called the ML potential, MLP would be essential in providing a long time scale and large atomistic scale simulations at a near-DFT level. The development of general-purpose interatomic potentials is one of the most promising applications of ML to research. However, though there are some typical works that report the precise development of carboncatalyst interactions,58 the applications of MLFF for molten catalysis CH4 pyrolysis remain rare. We anticipate that such MLFF will be used to simulate the realistic CH4 pyrolysis systems and, eventually, to accelerate the development of multicomponent molten catalysts design technologies. iv. Disciplinary CooperationThe research of molten catalysts CH4 pyrolysis encompasses interdisciplinary knowledge spanning physics, chemistry, and materials science, while the design of molten catalysts systems entails data-driven multiobjective performance optimiza- tion, necessitating the integration of interdisciplinary strategies and methodologies. Thus, the development of data-driven tools necessitates collaborative efforts among researchers from diverse disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and computer science.

However, its interfacial structure and catalytic behavior remain poorly understood. Here we developed an integrated operando Raman spectroscopy and mass spectrometry MS method, to directly investigate the CO2 reduction mechanism at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface within a practical MEA electrolyzer operating at high current densities. Combined with isotope labeling experiments and ab initio molecular dynamics AIMD simulations, we provide, for the first time, the direct spectroscopic evidence of CCO, a crucial intermediate for C2 product formation, which has been frequently hypothesized but rarely detected in previous studies. By contrast, the linearly adsorbed COL intermediate, typically observed in conventional liquid electrolytes, was absent. These distinct behaviors arise from the unique structure of the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface, which shifts the rate-determining step from the usual C-C coupling to the CCO hydrogenation in the conversion of CO2 to C2 products. This study not only deepens our understanding of electrodepolyelectrolyte interfacial characteristics, but also offers valuable insights for advancing the performance of CO2 MEA electrolyzers.

At the heart of these technologies is the electrodeelectrolyte interface, where electrochemical reactions occur.7 A thorough exploration of the interfacial structure and its impact on electrochemical processes is thus essential.8 This understanding is crucial for the rational design of key materials, such as efficient electrode catalysts and electrolytes, and for advancing the performance of electrochemical technologies.9 Early electrochemical studies primarily relied on electrical signals for both excitation and detection, through applying varying potentialsvoltages or currents and observing the corresponding responses to probe the electrodeelectrolyte interface.10 Since the 1970s, the introduction of various spectroscopic techniques, such as electrochemical in-situ infrared and Raman spectroscopy, has enabled the acquisition of molecular- and atomic-scale information at the electrodeelectrolyte interface during electrochemical testing,1113 significantly deepening our understanding of electrochemical interfaces and reaction mechanisms. Nevertheless, it is important to note that most electrochemical in-situ spectroscopies developed to date focus on studying the electrodeliquid electrolyte interface. In contrast, modern electrochemical technologies increasingly employ polymer electrolytes i.e., polyelectrolytes instead of liquid electrolytes e.g., HClO4, KOH solution.14 This shift enables the construction of zero-gap membrane electrode assembly MEA devices, which help reduce internal resistance and thus improve electrochemical energy conversion efficiency.15 The inherent differences between polyelectrolytes and liquid electrolytessuch as variations in ionic species organic versus inorganic and ionic mobility bound versus freeinevitably result in significant differences in the microstructure and catalytic behavior at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface compared to the conventional electrodeliquid electrolyte interface. For instance, our recent studies have shown that CO2 reduction can occur at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface with immobilized organic cations, a reaction that is challenging to achieve in liquid electrolytes containing free organic cations.16,17 Additionally, to facilitate spectroscopic detection, these widely used in-situ spectroscopies 10.1002anie.202509423 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

These variations in operating conditions can even lead to markedly different catalytic behaviors.20,21 For instance, a previous study demonstrated that while the nonprecious Mn-Co catalyst shows inferior oxygen reduction reaction ORR performance compared to PtC in aqueous KOH electrolyte, this trend reverses in alkaline",

These variations in operating conditions can even lead to markedly different catalytic behaviors.20,21 For instance, a previous study demonstrated that while the nonprecious Mn-Co catalyst shows inferior oxygen reduction reaction ORR performance compared to PtC in aqueous KOH electrolyte, this trend reverses in alkaline polyelectrolyte fuel cells APEFCs with gas diffusion electrodes GDEs operating at 60C, due to differences in water content at the catalytic interfaces.22 Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop operando spectroscopic methods that are compatible with the operating conditions of MEA devices, to more accurately reveal the structural characteristics and catalytic behavior of the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface under practical working conditions. Indeed, some progress has been made in probing the interfaces within practical MEA-type fuel cells and water electrolyzers, through the combined use of techniques such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy XAS,23 near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy NAP-XPS,24,25 infrared spectroscopy,26,27 and Raman spectroscopy.28,29 However, operando studies focusing on CO2 MEA electrolyzers, particularly those operating in a polyelectrolytepure water medium without any liquid electrolytes, remain rather limited. In this study, we develop an integrated operando Raman spectroscopy and mass spectrometry MS method using the MEA configuration, to investigate CO2 reduction at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface. This approach allows for the simultaneous detection of interfacially adsorbed intermediates and volatile products such as CO, CH4, C2H4, C2H5OH, and others under industrial-scale current densities, providing molecular insights into the CO2 reduction mechanism in practical MEA electrolyzers. Notably, unlike the linearly adsorbed COL intermediate commonly observed in Cu-catalyzed CO2 reduction in KOH or KHCO3 aqueous electrolytes,30 we are surprised to find that COL is absent at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface.

Results and discussion To compare the CO2 reduction behavior at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface with that at the conventional electrodeliquid electrolyte interface, we developed two types of spectroelectrochemical cells.

The counter and reference electrodes were immersed in the electrolyte solution. The excitation laser passes through a quartz window and a thin layer of the electrolyte solution, allowing the Raman scattering signals at the electrodeliquid electrolyte interface to be collected Figure S3a. Although this GDE- based setup significantly enhances CO2 mass transport and allows for electrochemical testing at current densities exceeding 100 mAcm2, the high internal resistance between the working and counter electrode, due to their large separation distance, makes operation at higher current densities challenging. Additionally, at higher current densities 300 mAcm2, vide infra, a large number of gas bubbles will form on the electrode surface, which can severely interfere with Raman signal collection.

An IrO2-coated Ti anode was tightly pressed against the opposite side of the QAPPT membrane. A hydrophobic carbon paper with pre-drilled small holes 100 μm, Figure S6 was used as the gas diffusion layer, and a quartz optical window was installed at the cathode flow field. This design allows the excitation laser with a spot diameter of approximately 1 μm to pass through the flow field and small holes, reaching the cathode catalyst layer for Raman signal collection Figure S3b. Notably, the cathodic incidence detection can effectively eliminate the interference of fluorescence signals from alkaline polyelectrolyte membranes e.g., QAPPT in this study, which typically contain a large number of conjugated benzene-ring structures. In addition to the Raman characterization, a capillary sampling port was introduced at the cathode outlet for MS analysis. This setup enables the collection of reaction intermediate information at the cathode interface by Raman and the simultaneous analysis of corresponding volatile products by MS for the CO2 MEA electrolyzer under its normal operating conditions.

Testing at higher current densities was limited due to interference from gas bubbles, as mentioned above. The obtained spectra are consistent with those reported in the literature,34,35 displaying some characteristic vibrational bands. The bands at around 280 cm1, 360 cm1, and 2060 cm1 correspond to the frustrated rotation, Cu-CO stretching, and C-O stretching of linearly adsorbed COL, respectively,3638 which is generally considered a key intermediate for CO2 deep reduction into CH4 as well as C2 products e.g., C2H4, C2H5OH.39 The band at 526 cm1 is attributed to surface Cu-OH species.40,41 The bands at 1015 cm1 and 1070 cm1 correspond to the HCO3 and CO32, respectively,42,43 with their relative intensity reflecting the local pH near the electrode surface. The band at 1386 cm1 can be assigned to the C-O vibration of COOH intermediate.44,45 Additionally, the bands at 1600 cm1 and 3000- 3600 cm1 are associated with the bending δH2O and stretching νO-H vibration of interfacial water, respectively.46,47 Figure 2b shows the operando Raman spectra for CO2 reduction at the CuQAPEEK i.e., electrodepolyelectrolyte interface across current densities ranging from 50 to 700 mAcm2, obtained using the MEA setup illustrated in Figure 1b.

This band at 460 cm1 is distinct from both Cu-COL and Cu-OH species and likely consists of two different vibrations or species, as indicated by its asymmetric peak 10.1002anie.202509423 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

The local pH values for the two systems under different current densities were calculated using the CO32HCO3 integral area ratio and the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation Figure S9, Note 1,50 revealing a higher pH at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface.

    "text": "Commons License 9 Specifically, the movement of anions e.g., OH is somewhat constrained by the alkaline polyelectrolyte-bounded cations, hindering the rapid transfer of OHgenerated from CO2 reduction and water dissociationaway from the electrode surface. Another significant observation is the complete disappearance of the νO-H band at the CuQAPEEK interface Figure 2b, 2f. This can be attributed to two factors: first, the reduced water content at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface due to the presence of the hydrophobic backbone of QAPEEK; and second, the preservation of a strong hydrogen bonding network within the water at this interface, due to the inability of the polyelectrolyte-tethered organic cations to form a compact double layer under negative potentials, as found in our previous study.17 There is a broad consensus that Raman spectroscopy is insensitive to water, but recent research suggests that the disruption of hydrogen bonding network is critical for detecting water vibrations via surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.51 This explains why the νO-H band can be detected at the electrodeliquid electrolyte interface Cu1 M KHCO3, Figure 2a, whereas it cannot be detected at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface CuQAPEEK, Figure 2b. To identify these specific species and their formation mechanism, as well as examine their relevance to CO2 reduction at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface, various CO2 reduction volatile products, including CO, CH4, C2H4, and C2H5OH, were simultaneously monitored in real-time using the operando MS technique Figure 1b, alongside Raman measurement. The yields of these products generally exhibited an increasing trend with rising current densities Figure 3a. Figure 3b presents the average ion currents of these products at different current densities, while Figure 3c displays the integral areas of the unidentified band at 1945 cm1. Notably, as the current density increased, there was a strong correlation between the generation rate of C2 products C2H4 and C2H5OH and the peak intensity at 1945 cm1. Both showed a synchronized changing profile, which was different from the generation rates of CO and CH4. This suggests that the band at 1945 cm1 likely corresponds to a key intermediate involved in the C2 products formation. Furthermore, the correlation between the generation rates of these volatile products and the COB peak intensity is minimal Figure S10, supporting claims in the literature that COB acts as a surface inactive poisoning species and cannot undergo subsequent reduction.48 10.1002anie.202509423 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

To identify the newly detected species at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface, we conducted isotopic experiments employing 13C- and D-labelling Figure 4a-4c, Figure S11. The 12CO213CO2 exchange resulted in a noticeable redshift of the Raman bands at 1945 cm1, 1834 cm1, 460 cm1, and 353 cm1 Figure 4b, 4c. In contrast, these bands exhibited negligible shifts in the H2OD2O isotope exchange, indicating that the corresponding species contain carbon but no hydrogen. Specifically, the band shift from 1834 cm1 to 1793 cm1 aligns well with the estimated value for COB Supporting Note 2. For the unidentified band at 1945 cm1, which is associated with C2 products formation, a redshift from 1945 cm1 to 1913 cm1 was observed during the 12CO213CO2 exchange. Previous studies have suggested that the vibration bands in the 19002000 cm1 range may correspond to two adjacent adsorbed CO in the co-existence of OH,52 multi-bound CO,53 or CCO.54 However, based on the band shift value noted in the isotope experiments, we can rule out the possibility that this band corresponds to surface-adsorbed CO species Supporting Note 2. On the other hand, CCO is often regarded as an intermediate in the conversion of CO2 to C2 products.

Our analysis indicates that both the isotope-induced band shifts from 1945 cm1 to 1913 cm1 and from 460 cm1 to 453 cm1 are consistent well with two vibration modes of the CCO Supporting Note 2, and the changes in the integral areas of the two peaks also show a strong correlation as the current density increases Figure 2b, S12. Moreover, the band at 1945 cm1 is also quite closely matched to that of the CCO molecule in the gas phase.57,58 According to our further AIMD calculations Figure S13, the band at 1945 cm1 can be assigned to the asymmetric stretching vibration, while the band at 460 cm1 corresponds to the bending vibration of CCO.

See the Terms and Conditions https:onlinelibrary.wiley.comterms-and-conditions on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 12 Based on the results mentioned above and the CO2 reduction pathways hypothesized in previous studies,31 the unusual CO2 reduction reaction pathways at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface i.e., CuQAPEEK can be schematically illustrated in Figure 4d. The high local pH at this interface Figure S9, generally believed to facilitate C-C coupling,59,60 leads to the rapid consumption and conversion of active COL. This explains why COL is not observed in operando Raman spectra. Moreover, in the preceding steps for CCO generation, protonation primarily occurs at the highly electronegative oxygen Oδ site rather than at carbon Cδ, for example, as seen in the step of COOH formation. Due to the restricted mobility of polyelectrolyte-tethered organic cations, a rigid hydrogen bonding network is maintained at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface under negative potentials, with a high proportion of strongly hydrogen-bonded water sh-H2O. It is reasonable to infer that the Hδ in sh-H2O can readily interact with the Oδ in these oxygen-containing intermediates, facilitating direct protonation with interfacial water via the Eley-Rideal mechanism.61 However, for the further conversion of CCO, the protonation of α-C to form CHCO is thermodynamically more favorable.62 To elucidate the protonation process of CCO, we conducted density functional theory DFT calculations. The calculations demonstrate that the protonation of α-C atom via the Eley- Rideal mechanismwhere CCO reacts with dangling water molecules above the electrode surfaceis not feasible, restricted by the substantial spatial separation between them. Instead, due to the proximity of the α-C atom to the electrode surface, the only viable pathway for this protonation process follows the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, where the reaction occurs with surface-adsorbed water H2O, Figure S14. Nonetheless, this pathway still needs to overcome a relatively high transition-state energy barrier of 0.89 eV Figure 4e. In addition, due to the low water content and the constraint imposed by the rigid hydrogen bonding network at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface, the transport and adsorption of water molecules onto the electrode surface are significantly limited. Consequently, the conversion rate of CCO to CHCO is relatively slow, allowing the Raman detection of the CCO intermediate. This also explains the absence of Cu-OH species 526",

See the Terms and Conditions https:onlinelibrary.wiley.comterms-and-conditions on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 13 in the literature.34,63,64 This is because surface OH i.e., Cu-OH is another product from the Langmuir-Hinshelwood hydrogenation reaction with surface-adsorbed water H2O, Figure 4e upper, and thus its formation is similarly hindered. Overall, the distinct electrodepolyelectrolyte interfacial structure shifts the rate-determining step from the usual C- C coupling to the CCO hydrogenation in the conversion of CO2 to C2 products. Conclusions In summary, we have investigated the CO2 reduction mechanism at the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface within a practical MEA electrolyzer by combining operando Raman and MS analyses. We successfully captured direct spectroscopic evidence of a key CCO intermediate for C2 products formation, which was further verified through 13C- and D- isotopic substitution experiments as well as AIMD calculations. Notably, the CCO intermediate has been rarely detected in previous studies on CO2 reduction in conventional liquid electrolytes. This observation is due to the distinct structural characteristics of the electrodepolyelectrolyte interface, including a relatively high local pH, lower water content, and a more rigid hydrogen bonding network in the interfacial water. These features favor the Eley-Rideal type hydrogenation and disfavor the Langmuir-Hinshelwood type hydrogenation in CO2 reduction, thus promoting the conversion of surface-active COL to CCO while limiting its further protonation. These findings can not only facilitate the design of efficient electrocatalytic interfaces in practical MEA electrolyzers for CO2 and pure water co-electrolysis, but also highlight the importance of developing operando spectroscopic methods for studying interfacial catalysis under MEA working conditions. Further efforts can be made to introduce a stable and reliable reference electrode into the MEA device, in order to probe changes in interfacial species at different electrode potentials, rather than just observing their variations relative to current densities. Although some studies have attempted this, eliminating the measurement errors resulting from non-uniform currentpotential distributions still poses a challenge.65,66 10.1002anie.202509423 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

Abstract: Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction NO3RR is a promising approach to simultaneously realize pollutant removal and ammonia generation. However, this process involves the transfer of eight electrons and nine protons along with multiple by-products, resulting in a significant challenge for achieving high ammonia yield and selectivity. Herein, we introduced bimetallic covalent organic frameworks catalysts with Cu and Co active sites to achieve a two- step tandem reaction, avoiding excessive nitrite accumulation and enabling efficient NO3RR. For the initial two-electron process, the Cu sites in the bimetallic catalyst exhibit a strong binding affinity with nitrate, promoting their conversion to nitrite. The Co sites enhance the supply and adsorption of active hydrogen and stabilize the subsequent six-electron process, thereby improving the overall catalytic efficiency. Compared to monometallic Cu and Co catalysts, the CuCo bimetallic catalyst demonstrates superior ammonia yield and Faradaic efficiency NH3",

Compared to monometallic Cu and Co catalysts, the CuCo bimetallic catalyst demonstrates superior ammonia yield and Faradaic efficiency NH3 yield rate 20.8 mgh1cm2, FE 92.16 in 0.3 M nitrate. Such coordinated two-step process advances the efficiency and applicability of NO3RR through optimizing a cascade catalytic reaction, thereby establishing an innovative path for the engineering of NO3RR electrocatalysts. Introduction Ammonia NH3 remains not only an essential precursor in chemical industries,1 but also a next-generation hydrogen storage medium and carbon-neutral energy carrier.2 However, the conventional Haber-Bosch process for industrial NH3 synthesis involves high-energy consumption and generates significant greenhouse gas emissions.3 As an attractive alternative, electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction NO3RR for NH3 synthesis has emerged due to its environmental friendliness and mild reaction conditions.4 Alternative to nitrogen and nitric oxide,4c, 5 NO3 benefits from its lower dissociation energy, higher solubility, and rapid reduction kinetics at the liquid-solid interface, thus being regarded as a more promising N source for NH3 production.4a, 6 Additionally, NO3 is a prevalent harmful pollutant in contaminated groundwater, industrial wastewater, and nuclear emissions, which poses risks to both the environment and human health. Consequently, converting nitrate into the value-added product NH3 is environmentally beneficial and economically advantageous. The NO3RR process NO3 8e 9H NH3 3H2O, E0 0.69 V vs. RHE involves a complicated eight-electron and nice-proton transfer process,7 and is prone to generate by- product NO2, NO, NH2OH, N2H4, etc..8 This complex process can be divided into two consecutive reactions: a 2e process from NO3 to NO2 and a 6e process from NO2 to NH3.9 Matching the reactivity of two-step reactions is crucial to achieve high ammonia yield and Faradaic efficiency FE. Early studies have shown that Cu could effectively facilitate the adsorption of NO3 due to the similarity of energy levels between the d orbitals of Cu and the LUMO of nitrate.10 Additionally, the low hydrogen accumulation on the Cu11 surface promotes NO3 reduction while suppressing hydrogen evolution reaction HER.12 However, insufficient H supply may kinetically limit the hydrogenation step in the NO3RR.13 This calls for the rational regulation of water adsorption and enhanced supply of H 14 over the surface of Cu-based catalyst.15 The inherent oxyphilic nature and electronegativity of Co could facilitate H adsorption and supply,16 creating an excellent interfacial environment for the NO3 hydrogenation process while mitigating the formation of by- products. Therefore, coupling the Cu and Co active sites has 10.1002anie.202507956 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

Hydrazone- linked COFs represent a promising platform for forming new metal coordination sites containing both N and O atoms after synthesis process, thereby ensuring robust stabilization of metal centers.23 Therefore, it can be envisioned that the chemical designability and tunability of hydrazone-linked COFs can not only provide a promising platform for manipulating the NO3RR process at the electrocatalytic interface, but also contribute to elucidating the cascade electrocatalytic mechanism and reaction pathway, as well as understanding the NO3RR catalytic process to improve ammonia yield and Faradaic efficiency. However, the research in this regard is scarcely reported. Herein, we introduced covalent organic frameworks electrocatalyst with bimetallic active sites to match the two-step cascade reaction, thus avoiding excessive nitrite accumulation and enabling an efficient NO3RR process through Cu-Co tandem mechanism. Focusing on the initial two-electron process, the Cu sites in the bimetallic catalyst exhibit a strong binding affinity with nitrate and promote their efficient conversion to nitrite. The Co sites enhance the supply and adsorption of active hydrogen during the later six-electron process, thereby improving the overall catalytic efficiency. Consequently, the CuCo bimetallic catalyst demonstrates superior ammonia yield and FE NH3 yield rate 20.8 mgh1cm2, FE 92.16 in 0.3 M nitrate, much higher than those of monometallic Cu and Co catalysts. Such a highly matched two-step process provides a feasible strategy for efficiently coupling the cascade process, thereby advances the efficiency and applicability of NO3RR. Results and Discussion A hydrazone-linked COFs catalyst with nitrogen-oxygen heteroatom coordination sites was successfully synthesized via a Schiff base reaction using a solvothermal method. As shown in Figure 1a, 4,4,4- 1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl tribenzaldehyde TTA and terephthalohydrazide TPH were used as monomers. The solvent ratio was optimized mesitylene: 1,4-dioxane 3:7, and the reaction was carried out at 120 C for 72 h to synthesize TTA-TPH. Then TTA-TPH was then dispersed in ethanol containing different concentrations of Cu ions, Co ions, or a mixture of Cu and Co ions. Subsequently, the covalent hydrazone bonds of TTA-TPH could effectively coordinate with metal ions under a nitrogen atmosphere at 60 C, yielding a series of crystalline hydrazone-linked COFs: TTA-TPH-Cu, TTA-TPH-Co, and TTA-TPH-CuCo. The Powder X-ray diffraction PXRD and nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements were performed on TTA- TPH and TTA-TPH-CuCo to analyze their crystallinity and porous characteristics.23b As shown in Figure 1b, four distinct diffraction peaks were clearly observed at 3.58, 6.13, 9.38, and 26.21, corresponding to the 100, 110, 120, and 001 crystal planes, respectively.

The PXRD experimental data of TTA-TPH were subjected to Pawley refinement, which providing good refinement values Rwp3.12 and Rp2.46. Besides, the experimental results showed good agreement with the simulated AA stacking model Figure 1c and Table S1, which possessed the P6 space group with unit cell parameters: ab28.98 Å, c3.37 Å, αβ90, γ120. Then the nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements were conducted to investigate the specific surface area, and the values of TTA-TPH and TTA-TPH-CuCo were calculated to be 844 m2g1 and 699 m2g1, respectively Figure 1d. The inset in Figure 1d shows that the pore size distribution of TTA-TPH and TTA-TPH-CuCo both located around 1.36 nm, which is in line with the simulated AA model. The morphology of TTA-TPH-CuCo was carefully studied using scanning electron microscopy SEM, transmission electron microscopy TEM, high-resolution TEM HR-TEM,23a and atomic force microscopy AFM. It could be clearly observed that the TTA-TPH-CuCo demonstrate a layered stacking morphology with an average thickness of approximately 510 nm Figure S1 and S2. The favorable nanoscale dimensions and large surface area are beneficial for the full exposure of active sites. As shown in Figure 1e-f, HR-TEM of TTA-TPH and TTA-TPH-CuCo both exhibited evident lattice fringes of 001 plane with a distance of 0.33 nm and long-range ordered channels, indicating the intactness of porous and ordered morphology before and after metallization. This aligns well with the PXRD and AA model simulations. Furthermore, the TEM and HR-TEM revealed no metallic clusters Figure S3, indicating the absence of aggregated metal clusters due to the highly ordered structure and uniformly dispersed hydrazine-bond coordination sites. Energy- dispersive X-ray spectroscopy EDS revealed a uniform distribution of C, N, and O throughout the entire TTA-TPH framework. It could be clearly observed that the Cu and Co elements were evenly distributed on the metallized TTA-TPH- CuCo framework Figure S4, providing significant possibility for NO3RR with high activity. We used Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy FT-IR, 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance NMR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS to verify the chemical structure of TTA-TPH and TTA-TPH-CuCo. Firstly, FT-IR spectra of TTA- TPH and TTA-TPH-CuCo both display a strong CN stretching vibration band at 1628 cm1,24 confirming the successful formation of hydrazone bonds Figure S5. Additionally, no significant changes were observed in the FT-IR spectra after metal coordination, indicating successful metalation without altering the framework structure. The characteristic NMR signals for the CN and CO bonds further confirming the formation of hydrazone bonds in our COF Figure S6. Furthermore, the XPS full spectra of TTA-TPH-Cu, TTA-TPH-Co and TTA-TPH-CuCo demonstrated the presence of C, N, O, Cu and Co elements in their frameworks Figure S7.

The Cu 2p spectrum of TTA-TPH- CuCo exhibits two characteristic peaks at binding energies of 935.5 eV and 933.4 eV,10a, 25 which can be assigned to Cu2 and Cu species, respectively Figure 2b. Similarly, the Co 2p spectrum displays distinct peaks at 781.2 eV and 782.8 eV,16a corresponding to Co3 and Co2 oxidation states Figure 2c. Notably, the binding energy positions of Cu 2p and Co 2p orbitals for TTA-TPH-CuCo reveals no observable shifts compared with TTA-TPH-Cu and TTA-TPH-Co Figure S9. This indicates that both Cu and Co maintain their original electronic environments through coordinating with electron-withdrawing groups -CN and -CO in the COFs, effectively suppressing the formation of metallic clusters. X-ray absorption near-edge structure XANES were further employed to clarify the chemical states and local coordination environments of Cu and Co in TTA-TPH-CuCo. As shown in the Cu K-edge XANES spectrum Figure 2d, the absorption edge of TTA-TPH-CuCo is positioned between those of CuO Cu2 and Cu2O Cu reference compounds, unambiguously demonstrating the coexistence of mixed Cu2 Cu oxidation states. Analogously, the Co K-edge XANES spectrum Figure 2g reveals an absorption edge energy situated between those of CoO Co2 and Co2O3 Co3, providing definitive evidence for the simultaneous presence of Co2 and Co3 species. This remarkable agreement between XANES and XPS results confirms the presence of bimetallic centers with multivalent characteristics in the TPH-CuCo system. Moreover, the valence state fitting curves demonstrate that the average oxidation states of Cu and Co atoms in TTA-TPH-CuCo are 1.84 and 2.65, respectively inset of Figure 2d and 2g. The Fourier-transformed extended X-ray absorption fine structure FT-EXAFS analysis revealed prominent coordination peaks at 1.50 Å for Cu and 1.45 Å for Co, corresponding to metal-ligand bonding distances characteristic of Cu-NCu-O and Co-NCo-O coordination environments,",

Overall, the above structural characterizations confirm that TTA- TPH-CuCo are efficiently fabricated with superior crystallinity, high porosity while enriching the Cu and Co active sites. We then conducted NO3RR tests at room temperature in an H-cell containing a neutral electrolyte 0.5 M K2SO4 with different concentrations of KNO3 0.1 M, 0.3 M, and 0.5 M to evaluate the electrocatalytic performance. As shown in Figure 3a and Figure S16, the linear sweep voltammetry LSV experiments were conducted in 0.5 M K2SO4 solution with and without 0.1 M NO3 from 0.05 V to 0.95 V vs. RHE. Firstly, the TTA-TPH-CuCo exhibits a significantly higher current density upon adding NO3 into the system, indicating the high NO3RR activity. Compared to the monometallic TTA-TPH-Cu and TTA-TPH-Co, the bimetallic TTA-TPH-CuCo shows a more positive onset potential, suggesting that the reaction could take place at a relatively positive potential, thereby reducing the energy required to initiate the reaction. Moreover, within the same potential range, TTA- TPH-CuCo displays a higher current density,",

Error bars in 3c-e correspond to the standard deviations of three measurements, the center value of error bars is the average of three measurements TTA-TPH-Co 2.1 mFcm2. The larger ECSA of TTA-TPH-CuCo indicates that more catalytic active sites are exposed to the electrolyte, allowing much effective interaction with NO3 and facilitating rapid mass transfer processes, thereby accelerating the NO3RR reaction rate. We further calculated the turnover frequency TOF of TTA-TPH-Cu, TTA-TPH-Co and TTA-TPH- CuCo catalysts, which were 4152 h1, 5193 h1 and 7882 h1 respectively under identical conditions Figure S18. This indicates that TTA-TPH-CuCo catalyst achieves significantly enhanced reaction throughput per active site per unit time, confirming its superior intrinsic activity per catalytic center. We then detailedly probed the effect of CuCo ratios in TTA- TPH-CuCo on NO3RR performance and determined their actual metal content using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy Figure S19. A series of catalysts with different CuCo ratios were subjected to NO3RR measurements at 0.75 V vs. RHE. We quantitatively determined ammonia concentration using UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, with the corresponding calibration curve presented in Figure S20. As displayed in Figure 3c, TTA-TPH-Cu48Co52 exhibited exceptional performance, achieving an NH3 yield rate of 14.22 mgh1cm2 and an FE of 90.48 Figure S21 in 0.5 M K2SO4 containing 0.1 M NO3 unless otherwise specified,",

Moreover, no hydroxylamine NH2OH was detected during the NO3RR process Figure S23. We also quantitatively analyzed the hydrogen produced during the NO3RR process using gas chromatography Figure S24. The results revealed that TTA-TPH-CuCo exhibited significantly lower FE for hydrogen production FE 3.8 compared to TTA-TPH-Cu FE17.3 and TTA-TPH-Co FE9.4, suggesting enhanced H utilization for the NO hydrogenation on this catalyst. In the NO3RR process, Cu dominates the first-step conversion of NO3 to NO2, generating a large amount of NO2. However, the insufficient H coverage on Cu surface results in kinetic limitations, where the limited H adsorption capacity fails to sustain the subsequent hydrogeneration rate required for NO2 conversion. This kinetic mismatch leads to significant NO2 accumulation, ultimately compromising the NH3-FE. In contrast, Co demonstrates exceptional catalytic performance in the critical second-stage conversion of NO2 to NH3. Comparative analysis reveals that TTA-TPH-Co achieves a 91 reduction in NO2 yield and 27 enhancement in NH3-FE compared to TTA-TPH-Cu, demonstrating Cos superior capability in preventing NO2 accumulation. Therefore, by adjusting the composition and distribution of Cu and Co active sites, TTA-TPH-CuCo achieves synergistic tandem catalysis, where Cu efficiently drives the reduction of NO3 to NO2 while Co ensures rapid NO2 conversion. This precisely engineered coordination between successive reaction steps enables TTA-TPH-CuCo to attain remarkable NH3 yields of 14.22 mgh1cm2 with FE values of 90.5 , representing a significant performance improvement over single-metal based catalysts TTA-TPH-Cu NH3 yield8.08 mgh1cm2, FE 64.5 and TTA-TPH-Co NH3 yield8.70 mgh1cm2, FE 81.2 . The excellent NO3RR performance of TTA-TPH-CuCo surpasses that of most reported catalysts Figure 3h and Table S4. The NO3RR performance is strongly influenced by the local chemical environment. In situ pH monitoring reveals minimal pH variation during NO3 adsorption due to mass transfer limitations, followed by a rapid pH surge triggered by accumulated OH Figure S25.

The competing NO3RR and HER processes exhibit pH-dependent behavior, where the alkaline conditions favor NO3RR kinetics while suppressing HER, thereby enhancing H utilization efficiency and overall NO3RR performance. We further conducted the NO3RR measurement over TTA- TPH-CuCo catalysts at different potential. As shown in Figure 3d and 3e, the NH3 yield and FE over the TTA-TPH-CuCo displays a volcano-shaped curve from 0.55 V to 0.95 V, and achieving highest NH3 yield of 20.8 mgh1cm2 and FE of 92.16 in 0.3 M nitrate at 0.75 V. When increasing the applied cathodic potential from 0.55 V to 0.75 V vs. RHE, the NH3 yield and FE gradually increased due to the gradually accelerated reaction kinetics of the NO3RR and high H utilization rate during hydrogenation steps. However, the further increase of cathodic potential lowered NH3 yield and FE due to the enhanced HER. Our catalyst also demonstrated excellent NH3 yield and FEs in 0.3 M NO3 compared with 0.1 M and 0.5 M. The poor activity under lower NO3 concentration could be attributed to the following two factors: the insufficient nitrate flux on the electrode surface restricts reaction kinetics, while the weakened mass transfer effect exacerbates competition from HER Figure S26. As the NO3 concentration increases, the mass transfer process becomes significantly enhanced, which promotes the adsorption of more H to participate in subsequent hydrogenation reaction. Such competitive adsorption inhibits the HER process, and the NH3 yield rate and FE gradually increase. However, when NO3 concentration reaches 0.5 M, the FE exhibits an unexpected decline. This phenomenon is attributed to insufficient H supply, resulting in substantial accumulation of NO2 intermediates. In addition, the cyclic stability tests were also conducted at 0.75 V vs. RHE over fifty consecutive cycles, with each cycle lasting half an hour. After each cycle, the working electrode was rinsed with deionized water, air-dried naturally, and reused without replacement. Compared to the first cycle, the NH3 yield decreased by only 0.37 mgh1cm2 after fifty cycles Figure 3f, and there was also no detectable Cu or Co signals were observed in post-reaction electrolyte solutions Figure S27, confirming the stable coordination of metallic species within the COF framework. Furthermore, the SEM and TEM after cycle test revealed unchanged morphology and preserved 001 lattice fringes with 0.33 nm Figure S28 and S29, while XRD patterns retained maintained characteristic diffraction peaks at 3.58 Figure S30. These results demonstrate the excellent structural robustness of TTA-TPH-CuCo, where the anchored metal centers resist agglomeration, leaching, and framework collapse during electrochemical measurements. The superior performance could be elaborated by the following reasons. Firstly, the COFs are functioned as promising support to anchoring Cu and Co single atoms with coordinatively unsaturated sites, efficiently avoiding the process of pyrolysis and the aggregation of Cu and Co atoms with inherent high surface free energy.

Firstly, the COFs are functioned as promising support to anchoring Cu and Co single atoms with coordinatively unsaturated sites, efficiently avoiding the process of pyrolysis and the aggregation of Cu and Co atoms with inherent high surface free energy. The ordered and stable structure of COFs and the dispersed active sites can inhibit the aggregation of metal atoms, thus enhancing the stability of the catalyst. Secondly, COFs are a type of crystalline porous organic polymer where predesigned organic linkers are precisely integrated into two-dimensional extended structures with periodic frameworks and well-defined pores utilizing dynamic covalent chemistry. By virtue of regular porous structures, precisely tunable pore sizes, long-range ordered crystalline topological networks, and atomically dispersed metal sites, COFs could provide a unique research perspective for facilitating rapid electron transport, optimizing the mass transfer kinetics of NO3, revealing complex reaction mechanism. Based on the excellent NO3RR performance of TTA-TPH- CuCo, a Zn-NO3 battery was assembled with TTA-TPH-CuCo as the cathode and zinc foil as the anode to simultaneously eliminate nitrate, produce ammonia and generate power Figure S31.

    "text": "NH3 is from the electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction, rather than other sources such as the catalyst or the experimental setup. The NH3 yield were further determined via 1H NMR, with the corresponding calibration curve presented in Figure S33. The results were consistent with the performance obtained by the indophenol blue method Figure S33d when using 15NH4 or 14NH4 as a reactant, demonstrating the reliability of the two methods. In addition, to obtain information on intermediates and identify the reaction pathway of NO3RR over prepared catalysts, in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry DEMS was used to capture volatile gaseous molecules generated during the reaction. In the in situ DEMS measurements of TTA-TPH- CuCo Figure 4a, the apparent signal of mz 17 and weak peaks of mz 2 were captured, which could be assigned to the main product NH3 and by-product H2. Meanwhile, the NO3RR process over TTA-TPH-Cu exhibited notable HER activity, with substantial H2 evolution being detected in the DEMS measurement Figure S34 and S35. In contrast, the TTA-TPH-Co catalyst demonstrated effective suppression of HER. Notably, the incorporation of Co sites in the bimetallic TTA-TPH-CuCo significantly enhanced the utilization efficiency of H for the NO hydrogenation, thereby effectively suppressing competitive HER. The DEMS also revealed characteristic signals of critical intermediates NOH and NH₂, with TTA-TPH-CuCo displaying enhanced signal intensities for both species Figure S36. These findings conclusively verifying the tandem catalytic mechanism of TTA-TPH-CuCo in NO3RR. This mechanism achieves efficient cascade catalysis by efficiently matching the two-step reaction, namely the 2-electron-mediated intermediate conversion process and subsequent 6-electron hydrogenation stages, achieving 10.1002anie.202507956 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

Additionally, critical reaction intermediates with a characteristic mz value of 31 was also detected through in situ DEMS, corresponding to either NOH or NHO, which has great effect on the subsequent reaction. In order to further confirm the reaction pathway, in situ attenuated total reflection-surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy ATR-IRAS was used to confirm solution-phase intermediates and adsorbed species on the electrode surface. The in situ ATR-IRAS measurements were conducted in a 0.5 M K2SO4 solution containing 0.1 M KNO3. The catalytic behavior at different potential was systematically investigated over a cathodic potential window spanning from 0.35 to 1.35 V vs. RHE Figure 4b. The controlled-potential electrolysis was maintained at 0.75 V vs. RHE for 60-minute duration were also explored Figure 4e and Figure S37.

    "text": "at 1150,28 125029 and 130230 cm-1 are attributed to NH2, NO2 and NOH, while the gradually increasing peak at 164131 cm-1 indicates the accumulation of adsorbed NH3. In the broad overlapping absorption band in the range of 3000 to 3700 cm-1,32 the peaks at 3600, 3360 and 3190 cm-1 are attributed to vN-H, vO-H of adsorbed H2O, and NOH respectively. With increasing applied potential or prolonged reaction time, the intensities of these key intermediates increased, clearly indicating the active progression of the NO3RR process from NO3 to NH3. In combination the in situ DEMS with ATR- IRAS results, we could conclude that the conversion of NO3 to NH3 proceeds via the following possible pathways:NO3 NO2 NO NOH N NH NH2 NH3. In a neutral system, the hydrogen ions H requisite for the hydrogenation process during the NO3RR predominantly stem from the interfacial water adsorbed on the catalyst surface. As shown in Figure 4c and 4d, the in situ ATR-IRAS analysis of TTA- TPH-CuCo in the 3000 to 3700 cm-1 region revealed a characteristic vibrational signal assignable to interfacial water,33 which was resolved through Gaussian deconvolution into three states: tetra-coordinated hydrogen-bonded water 4-HB-H2O, bi- coordinated hydrogen-bonded water 2-HB-H2O, and alkali metal-ion-coordinated water K-H2O.30, 34 This multimodal water coordination architecture suggests the formation of dynamic hydration layers at the electrocatalyst-electrolyte interface, where the K-H2O is closely associated with water dissociation.35 Notably, the area fraction of K-H2O consistently maintained the highest proportion among interfacial hydration components, exhibiting a remarkable enhancement from 0.9 to 21.9 when decreasing the applied potential. This result suggests that TTA- TPH-CuCo facilitates the dissociation of H2O, generating a sufficient H supply on the catalyst surface, thereby promoting the efficient progression of NO3RR. The sufficient supply of H is the key to ensure the steady and efficient progress of the NO3RR. We then further monitor the H signal during NO3RR process via electron paramagnetic resonance EPR spectroscopy by using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline- N-oxide DMPO as H trapping agent. In a 0.5 M K2SO4 solution, nine characteristic peaks corresponding to H with an intensity ratio approaching 1:1:2:1:2:1:2:1:1 were achieved. As evidenced by Figure S38, introduction of NO3 triggers significant attenuation of H signals in the TTA-TPH-CuCo system, demonstrating active participation of these H during the hydrogenation of NO3RR intermediates. This substantial H consumption correlates with enhanced catalytic activity and accelerated reaction dynamics observed in the bimetallic CuCo catalyst system. In contrast, both the supply and consumption levels of H in the TTA-TPH-Cu were inferior to those in the Co-containing system, which hinder the hydrogenation of the intermediates, resulting in lower activity with a FE of 64.5 in 0.1 M NO3 and 0.5 M K2SO4. Furthermore, the sustained and stable supply of H is critical for enhancing activity and efficiency. To monitor the temporal evolution of H content, EPR spectra were recorded at 5 and 10 min, represented by gray and colored lines, respectively Figure 4f. The content of H in the TTA-TPH-CuCo system remained nearly constant after 10 minutes, indicating its ability to",

The content of H in the TTA-TPH-CuCo system remained nearly constant after 10 minutes, indicating its ability to stably and continuously supply H, which supports the robust and efficient NO3RR performance of TTA-TPH-CuCo. In addition, the theoretical calculation of the H2O dissociation pathway further confirm that Co and its adjacent N and O atoms play important roles in the generation and utilization of H. As shown in Figure 4g, the H2O adsorption and dissociation on the N and O atoms adjacent to the Co site are much more favorable than those on the Cu site Figure S39, and the H2O adsorption and dissociation on the O atom are much more energetically favorable than N atom. As shown in Figure 4h, H2O is adsorbed on the O atom beside Co and dissociates into H-OH. The generated H is also more stably adsorbed on the O atom, forming an environment rich in H. This result demonstrated that the -N- Co-O- catalytic interface could enable efficient H supply for the NO3RR reaction, then the generated H can be immediately utilized in the hydrogenation process and maintain a dynamic equilibrium of H concentration. We further investigated the interaction between NO3 and TTA-TPH-CuCo catalyst through theoretical calculations. Firstly, we utilized the projected density of states PDOS to confirm the local electronic states near the Fermi level EF of TTA-TPH- CuCo before and after the adsorption of NO3. The orbital overlap of Cu-3d, N-2p, and O-2p near the EF indicates the formation of new hybrid orbitals through strong electronic interactions, which ensures the effective charge transfer of the catalyst Figure 5a. After NO3 adsorption, the N NO3-2p orbitals of NO3 overlap with the above orbitals, revealing significant electronic coupling between NO3 and Cu active centers in the TTA-TPH-CuCo catalyst Figure 5b. The upshifted Cu-3d orbitals after NO3 adsorption further indicated the strong interaction between NO3 and Cu catalytic sites, which holds substantial significance for the subsequent NO3RR reaction. To elucidate the interfacial charge transfer, the differential charge density of TTA-TPH-CuCo before and after NO3 adsorption was calculated in Figure 5c, where cyan represents the loss of charge and yellow represents the gain of charge. It could be seen that there was an obvious electron transfer between the metallic Cu site and NO3. The bader calculation shown that the electron of Cu is decreased from 10.41 to 10.22, featuring an electron accumulation on NO3 Δq0.19 e. Furthermore, theoretical calculations in Figure 5d revealed that the NONOH step had a lower endothermic energy barrier 0.63 eV compared to the NO NHO step 0.8 eV, indicating that the former is a more favorable pathway and agreeing well 10.1002anie.202507956 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

For the rate-determining NO3 NO3H hydrogenation step, the Cu site exhibits a lower activation barrier ΔG 0.49 eV compared to the Co site ΔG 0.57 eV. This thermodynamic preference, combined with enhanced NO3 adsorption due to favorable orbital hybridization, confirming that Cu center is the primary center for initiating the 2- electron reduction pathway. As shown in Figure 5e, the theoretical calculations further revealed distinct catalytic function of Cu and Co sites in governing the NO3RR pathway energetics. Critical to subsequent steps, the adsorption of NO2 intermediate shows evident site dependence, with Co exhibiting stronger adsorption energy 4.89 eV than Cu 4.00 eV. The free energy change of the process from Cu site to Co site is 0.89 eV, which is a spontaneous process and thermodynamically favorable. For the NO2 NO2H hydrogenation step, the Co site exhibits a beneficial energy barrier ΔG 1.38 eV compared to the Cu site ΔG 1.23 eV.

In this process, the tandem Cu and Co active sites, as the key mediators of electron transfer, ultimately enabling efficient conversion from NO3 to NH3. These simulation results are in excellent agreement with our experimental conclusions from in situ DEMS and in situ ATR-IRAS, clearly clarifying the tandem catalytic mechanism of TTA-TPH-CuCo in NO3RR Figure 5f. Firstly, the mismatch rates between the rapid conversion process of NO3 on TTA-TPH-Cu and the subsequent sluggish hydrogenation process leads to the accumulation of NO2. The shortage of NO2 on TTA-TPH-Co also prevents the realization of high-efficient NH3 production performance. For TTA- TPH-CuCo, the Cu site significantly adsorbs NO3, serving as the adsorption and activation center in the NO3RR process. Subsequently, the -N-Co-O- interface simultaneously promotes the dissociation of H₂O and the supply of H to ensure the steady progress of the subsequent hydrogenation process. The tandem catalysis of Cu and Co optimizes the intermediate steps and transition states of the reaction, thereby accelerating the kinetics of the proton-coupled electron transfer reaction. Conclusion In summary, we have designed and fabricated a bimetallic TTA- TPH-CuCo catalysts with tandem active sites for the cascade conversion of nitrate to ammonia. Compared with the monometallic counterparts, TTA-TPH-CuCo achieves a high NH3 yield rate of 20.8 mgh1cm2 with FE of 92.16 in 0.3 M nitrate, outperforming most of the reported NO3RR electrocatalysts in the literature. Through in situ DEMS, in situ ATR-IRAS, and theoretical calculations, we have elucidated the cascade mechanism occurring over the TTA-TPH-CuCo. The Cu sites function as the activation centers for adsorption and the initial 2e process. The N-Co-O- interface promotes water adsorption and dissociation, facilitates the formation of H-rich interface and boosts the subsequent 6e process, thus accelerating efficient synthesis of ammonia. This work not only emphasizes the achievement of efficient NO3RR through matching a two-step tandem reaction, but also paves the way for designing highly efficient electrocatalysts for NO3RR and possible other reactions in which high selectivity is desired.

Herein, this challenge is addressed through sulfur-induced electronic modulation of Ag-based catalysts, steering the CO2 reduction pathway toward ethanol production. By constructing atomically engineered AgAg2S nanowires NWs via a controlled sulfurization strategy, a remarkable Faradaic eﬃciency FE of 75 for ethanol at 0.95 V, along with exceptional stability over 14 h of high-performance metrics surpassing most reported Ag-based systems is achieved. Operando electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy EC-SERS and density functional theory DFT calculations unveil that the AgAg2S heterointerface synergistically regulates interfacial water networks and stabilizes key CO intermediates, thereby accelerating CO2 activation, proton-coupled electron transfer, and asymmetric C-C coupling. Furthermore, sulfurization-induced dual eﬀects-optimized hydrogen-bond interactions and enriched K conﬁnement are identiﬁed as critical drivers for tailoring the local microenvironment to favor ethanol selectivity. This work not only demonstrates a rational atomic interface design for C2 product orientation but also deciphers the dynamic interplay between catalyst electronic structure and interfacial species, oﬀering a molecular-level roadmap for advanced CO2 conversion systems.

Introduction CO2 electroreduction to valuable fuels and chemicals, driven by clean electricity from renewable energy, presents an attractive route to achieve CO2 utilization for allevi- ating the current energy crisis and green- house gas emissions.1 Among various products, ethanol is highly desired because it is not only a commonly used indus- trial material but also a fuel with high energy density.2 Yet it remains a great challenge to convert CO2 to ethanol with high selectivity due to the low controlla- bility over C-C coupling.3 Silver Ag is reported to achieve high CO Faradaic ef- ﬁciency FE exceeding 90 during CO2 electroreduction.4 Since CO is the key in- termediate to realize C-C coupling to pro- duce ethanol, strategies to further reduce CO on Ag-based catalysts have drawn in- creasing attention. Wang et al. reported the design of Ag-doped InSe nanosheets with Se vacancies which enables CO2 elec- troreduction to a single liquid product of ethanol.5 The heterointerface of Ag and InSe promotes CO2 activation and protona- tion via the synergistic stabilization of in- termediates.

We have found the partially oxidized Ag nanowires NWs can improve the ethanol selectivity via the enhanced CO adsorption energy.6 However, it is diﬃcult to maintain both selectivity and durability on the naturally oxi- dized Ag surface experimentally, and there is a lack of clear deﬁni- tion for active sites mechanically. AgAg2S heterostructures can promote the CO2 electroreduction activity and CO selectivity,7 but how to modify Ag catalysts interface using sulfur to improve the CO2 electroreduction to C2 products such as ethanol remains a signiﬁcant challenge, while understanding mechanisms is even more challenging. Investigation of mechanisms underlying CO2 electroreduction requires real-time identiﬁcation of dynamic interfacial species, particularly carbonaceous intermediates, and interfacial water. Detection of C1 intermediates is crucial for elucidating the re- action mechanism at the initial stage.8 In contrast, C2 interme- diates are more challenging to detect due to their lower surface coverage and transient nature, yet they oﬀer deeper mechanis- tic insights, such as conﬁrming the occurrence of C-C coupling and explaining the selectivity between ethanol and ethylene.9 Adv.

Despite its importance, interfacial water has been largely over- looked in previous studies, even though it plays an essential role in revealing the microenvironment during CO2 electrore- duction. For instance, Liu et al. found that the competitive adsorption of K and H revealed by interfacial water inﬂu- ences CO2 electroreduction performance via the variations in local pH.10 Wang et al. found that the optimized H forma- tion determined by strong hydrogen-bonded water leads to the balance between hydrogen evolution reaction HER and inter- mediate hydrogenation.11 While optimal H supply from in- terfacial water has been linked to promoted CO2 electroreduc- tion, its multifaceted roles, including hydrogen bonding and cation eﬀects, merit further investigation.1013 Operando elec- trochemical surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy EC-SERS has emerged as one of the powerful techniques for molecular ﬁngerprint recognition during CO2 electroreduction. Therefore, insights into intermediates and dynamic behaviors of interfacial water from EC-SERS allow for a more comprehensive reconstruc- tion of the reaction process, thereby advancing our understand- ing of underlying mechanisms. Herein, we systematically investigated how interfacial water, along with carbonaceous intermediates and the electronic struc- ture of AgAg2S NWs inﬂuences ethanol selectivity and sta- bility in CO2 electroreduction by operando EC-SERS.

Results 2.1. Characterization of Ag NWs and AgAg2S NWs Transmission electron microscope TEM, energy dispersive spectroscopy EDS, and X-ray diﬀraction XRD were used to characterize Ag NWs and AgAg2S NWs. The width of Ag NWs is 180 nm and Ag2S is distributed in the shape of an island on Ag NWs after sulfurization Figure 1a,b. The sulfurized Ag can be clearly seen from the surface of AgAg2S NWs, while the lattice fringes of 0.257 and 0.204 nm are corresponded to Ag2S022 and Ag2S103 Figure 1c. The EDS mapping image of AgAg2S NWs reveals a more distinct island-like distribution of Ag2S, highlight- ing regions where both Ag2S and Ag are exposed on the surface of AgAg2S NWs Figure 1d. Scanning electron microscope SEM and TEM images further supported the uniformity of AgAg2S interfaces Figures S1,S2, Supporting Information. XRD pat- terns of Ag NWs and AgAg2S NWs are shown in Figure 1e,f. The occurrence of a dozen small peaks between 20 and 60 in- cluding Ag2S111, Ag2S111, Ag2S112, Ag2S121, and Ag2S031 on the XRD pattern in the partially enlarged detail further demonstrates the formation of Ag2S on Ag NWs. Mul- tiple batches of synthesis conﬁrmed the reproducibility of Ag NWs and AgAg2S NWs by TEM, UVvis spectroscopy, XRD, and XPS across multiple batches Figures S2S6, Supporting Infor- mation. Synthesis formulas, SEM images, and XRD patterns of Ag NWs with diﬀerent sulfurization degrees are given in Sup- porting Information Table S1, Figures S7,S8, Supporting Infor- mation. 2.2. Selectivity and Stability of AgAg2S NWs for CO2 Electroreduction CO2 electroreduction behavior of Ag NWs and AgAg2S NWs was investigated by linear sweep voltammetry LSV Figure 2a and cyclic voltammetry CV Figure S9, Supporting Informa- tion.

The catalyst loading was optimized to maximize both current density and mass ac- tivity Figure S10, Supporting Information. Both Ag NWs and AgAg2S NWs exhibit enhanced mass activity and an increased onset potential upon transitioning from an Ar-saturated to a CO2- saturated electrolyte, indicating that catalysts based on Ag NWs can eﬀectively catalyze CO2 electroreduction. The larger diﬀer- ence in mass activity between Ag NWs and AgAg2S NWs il- lustrates sulfurization of Ag NWs can greatly enhance the cat- alytic performance of CO2 electroreduction. The mass activity of AgAg2S NWs is higher than that reported in the literature as well.14,15 The voltammetry curves normalized by geomet- ric area and estimated surface area of Ag exhibit consistent trends in the comparison of the activity in CO2 electroreduction Figure S11, Supporting Information. Therefore, the voltamme- try curves show the excellent activity of AgAg2S NWs in CO2 electroreduction. The sulfurization of Ag NWs to improve the selectivity was fur- ther investigated systematically. There are three kinds of main products obtained from Ag NWs and AgAg2S NWs, which are hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and ethanol Figure 2b. Among all the CO2 electroreduction products, liquid products were of most interest and quantiﬁed in the liquid phase using 1H nu- clear magnetic resonance 1HNMR Figure S12, Supporting In- formation, while the gas products were detected by gas chro- matography GC Figure S13, Supporting Information. The FE of formic acid detected in 1HNMR was calculated as less than 2 and thus was not included in statistics. Our Ag NWs- based catalysts yield a single liquid-phase product with little interference from other alcohols or acids, which is rare with other catalysts.16 Notably, sulfurization of Ag NWs promotes the production of ethanol and hinders hydrogen evolution reaction HER at each selected potential. For Ag NWs, the ethanol FE ﬁrst increases and then decreases with the decreasing potential from Adv.

The highest CO FE of 55 is obtained at 0.95 V versus RHE, while hydrogen becomes the main product at 1.05 and 1.15 V versus RHE. After sulfurization of Ag NWs, the ethanol FE triples at 0.95 V versus RHE to 75. For AgAg2S NWs, the ethanol FE was improved from 25 to 75 after sulfurization at 0.95 V versus RHE. The ethanol FE remains largely un- changed when the loadings of AgAg2S NWs are varied from 0.017 to 0.102 mg Figure S14, Supporting Information, indicat- ing that ethanol selectivity is independent of catalyst loading and likely determined by the local electronic structure and interme- diate binding at the AgAg2S interface. Therefore, sulfurization of Ag NWs can greatly enhance the ethanol selectivity for CO2 electroreduction. Furthermore, the sulfurization degree can greatly inﬂuence the CO2 electroreduction performance. The sulfurization degree was controlled by the concentration of Na2S solution used from 1 to 100 mм. When the Na2S concentration increased from 1 to 100 mм, the ethanol FE and partial current density jethanol ﬁrst in- creased and then decreased, reaching a maximum when the Na2S concentration is 10 mм Figure 2c,d, which means AgAg2S in- terface formed via sulfurization can improve ethanol selectivity, as well as accelerate ethanol production kinetics driven by overpo- tential Figure 2e. In fact, based on the analysis of the Tafel slope, the introduction of Ag2S can reduce electrochemical reaction ki- netics, reﬂecting a decrease in reaction rate Figure S15, Support- ing Information. When the sulfurization degree is too high 50 100 mм, the ethanol selectivity decreases because most of the surface is covered with Ag2S, and the poorly conductive Ag2S can- not participate in CO2 electroreduction eﬃciently. The AgAg2S NWs are outstandingly competitive among both non-copper Cu catalysts and Cu-based catalysts Figure 2f.1734 Therefore, ap- propriate sulfurization can improve the ethanol selectivity of Ag NWs for CO2 electroreduction. Besides the activity and selectivity, AgAg2S NWs can also im- prove the stability for CO2 electroreduction. We investigated the stability of Ag NWs and AgAg2S NWs under operating condi- tions by long-term electrolysis, and AgAg2S NWs exhibit much higher stability of ethanol selectivity than Ag NWs Figure 2g. In the long-term electrolysis, the current density of Ag NWs grad- ually increases with the competitive advantage of HER but the loss of ethanol selectivity Figure S16, Supporting Information. Oppositely, AgAg2S NWs can maintain a stable current density and ethanol selectivity during 14 h Figure 2g, along with the retention of AgAg2S heterointerface and Ag chemical state on AgAg2S NWs after CO2 electroreduction Figures S17,S18, Sup- porting Information, indicating the greater stability under oper- ating condition.",

In addition, Ag-based nanomaterials are highly susceptible to oxidation under ambient conditions, and their abil- ity to remain active under non-operating conditions is also an important performance indicator.6 Variation of the atomic ra- tio Δ of OAg as determined by XPS shows that Ag NWs are more susceptible to oxidation when exposed to ambient condi- tions Figure 2h. Ethanol selectivity of Ag NWs is completely lost in 20 days, while AgAg2S NWs yield a signiﬁcant amount of ethanol over 20 days Figure 2i, indicating greater stability un- der ambient conditions. TEM images of AgAg2S NWs with am- bient exposure for 10 days exhibit the same morphological struc- ture, conﬁrming that the AgAg2S heterointerface remains mor- phologically intact Figure S19, Supporting Information. Mean- while, XPS spectra of AgAg2S NWs with diﬀerent ambient ex- posure times reveal that the Ag 3d binding energy exhibits no obvious changes until 10 days, indicating the Ag electronic struc- ture remains largely unchanged for 10 days. Only the Ag MNN Auger spectra can detect a slight diﬀerence after 10 days. Figure S20, Supporting Information. Therefore, AgAg2S NWs can ef- fectively enhance stability both under operating and ambient con- ditions. 2.3. Eﬀect of AgAg2S Interface and Interfacial Electronic Structure AgAg2S NWs with diﬀerent sulfurization degrees were further investigated by XPS and electrochemical measurements to ﬁnd out factors enhancing the ethanol selectivity. SAg atomic ratios on the surfaces of Ag NWs with diﬀerent sulfurization degrees quantiﬁed by XPS Figure 3a increase with the Na2S concentra- tion and then remain constant after 10 mм. The binding energy of Ag3d Figure 3b ﬁrst decreases and then increases with Na2S concentration, reaching the lowest at 10 mм, which is consistent with the ethanol selectivity Figure 2c. The shift to lower binding energy at a relatively low sulfurization degree is due to the higher AgI proportion brought about by sulfurization.35 Via the ratio of Ag area to electrochemical surface area ECSA, we can quan- tify that the population of active Ag surface on AgAg2S NWs is 19 when Na2S concentration is 10 mм Figures S21,S22, and Table S2, Supporting Information. The shift to higher binding energy at a relatively high sulfurization degree is deduced to be caused by the adsorption of S2on the surface of Ag2S over a wide area. When sulfurization reaches a certain level, the remain- ing Ag surface no longer forms Ag2S, and S2is preferentially adsorbed on the Ag2S surface. The limit of sulfurization on Ag NWs is also evidenced by the ratios of Ag area to ECSA, where Ag areaECSA ratio for Ag NWs sulfurized by 100 mм Na2S 0.12 is similar to that for Ag NWs sulfurized by 50 mм Na2S 0.13, deviating from the expected decreasing",

The exposed Ag and in situ grown Ag2S form the AgAg2S interface. The importance of the AgAg2S interface is further emphasized by testing the CO2 electroreduction activity of me- chanically mixed Ag2S NPs and Ag NWs Ag2S NPs Ag NWs Figure 3d, which shares the same value of Ag areaECSA with AgAg2S NWs Table S2 and Figure S23, Supporting Informa- tion. The mixture of Ag2S NPs and Ag NWs exhibits the same FE distribution of products with Ag NWs, implying the separate Ag2S components do not contribute to the CO2 electroreduction performance of Ag NWs. While Ag2S NPs themselves cannot catalyze the conversion of CO2 to ethanol during CO2 electrore- duction as well. Therefore, a properly exposed AgAg2S interface plays an important role in CO2 electroreduction to ethanol. Building on the critical role of the properly exposed AgAg2S interface in enhancing ethanol selectivity, the unique interfa- cial electronic structure of AgAg2S, driven by electron trans- fer eﬀects, further improves the catalytic eﬃciency.

A marked charge accumulation is observed at the interface of AgAg2S, indicating an electron- rich region.

The work func- tion of AgAg2S is calculated to be 4.41 eV, which is lower than 4.52 eV for Ag and 4.96 eV for Ag2S, meaning electrons are more likely to be removed at the AgAg2S interface. The lower work function at the AgAg2S interface facilitates electron trans- fer, thereby boosting the catalytic eﬃciency of AgAg2S NWs in CO2 electroreduction.37 The AgAg2S interface is electron- rich and favors electron transfer during CO2 electroreduction. Therefore, electrochemical measurements combined with XPS, UVvisNIR Spectroscopy, and DFT calculations prove that the AgAg2S interface is the main active site of AgAg2S NWs dur- ing CO2 electroreduction to ethanol and the unique interfacial electronic structure promotes catalytic eﬃciency. 2.4. Mechanisms of Enhanced Ethanol Selectivity for CO2 electroreduction To investigate the molecular-level eﬀects of sulfurization on CO2 electroreduction, operando EC-SERS was employed to monitor intermediates formed during CO2 electroreduction on Ag NWs and AgAg2S NWs Figure 4a,b. The Raman spectra obtained from Ag NWs provide insight into the fundamental catalytic pro- cesses of Ag-based catalysts Figure 4a. Persistent peaks at 567 and 840 cm1 are attributed to 𝜈Ag-OH 𝜈, stretching vibra- tion and 𝛿AgO-H 𝛿, bending vibration, respectively, indicat- ing the stable adsorption of hydroxyl groups on Ag NWs in a CO2-saturated 0.5 м KHCO3.38 The hydroxyl likely contributes to the creation of an alkaline catalytic interface, which may ex- plain why Ag NWs demonstrate a certain eﬃciency in reducing CO2 to ethanol.39 Beyond these peaks, several others are observed consistently from 0.05 to 0.95 V: 260, 356, 589, 692, 1007, and 1030 cm1, cor- responding to Ag-CO frustrated rotation, 𝜈Ag-CO, 𝛿C-O, 𝛿Ag- CO3 2, 𝜈symmetricOCO, and 𝜈asymmetricOCO, respectively.4042 These peaks suggest that Ag NWs exhibit a preference for CO2 electroreduction and demonstrate the capacity for CO2 activation. The appearance of a peak at 1055 cm1, assigned to 𝜈C-O of COOH from 0.35 to 0.75 V, reﬂects the further reduction of activated CO2.43 As the potential decreases, the intensity of Ag- CO diminishes, while a new peak at 537 cm1 emerges. Based on 13C12C isotope exchange experiments Figure 4c, this peak can be attributed to CH2CHO, a critical intermediate in ethanol formation.43 Concurrently, the 𝛿OCO peak shifts from 730 to 725 cm1 as the potential decreases from 0.05 to 0.55 V.41 With further reduction, no peaks are observed below 725 cm1. A new peak at 731 cm1 emerges, shifting to 744 cm1 at 0.95 V, which is assigned to 𝛿C-H and appears alongside CH2CHO.41 These signals elucidate the CO2 electroreduction pathway leading to ethanol on Ag NWs. However, from 1270 to 2250 cm1, a promi- nent and persistent peak at 1761 cm1 is attributed to the 𝜈O- C stretch in formic acid.44 The absence of the commonly ob- served CO peak suggests that Ag exhibits weak adsorption of CO.",

In comparison to Ag NWs, AgAg2S NWs demonstrate en- hanced ethanol selectivity during CO2 electroreduction, as ev- idenced by the behavior of key carbonaceous intermediates Figure 4b. The peak corresponding to CH2CHO at 542 cm1 is more prominent over a broader potential range on AgAg2S NWs, indicating more eﬃcient C-C coupling and an improved ability to facilitate ethanol formation. The appearance of COOH in this potential range suggests that CO2 from the bulk electrolyte diﬀuses to the catalyst surface, where it is ac- tivated and protonated. Simultaneously, the 𝜈C-O stretch of CO at 2084 cm1 is observed on the AgAg2S NWs.6 The sustained presence of peaks related to COOH and CO im- plies stronger CO adsorption and higher CO surface cover- age on AgAg2S NWs, further enhancing its catalytic eﬃciency. Therefore, the enhanced ethanol selectivity on AgAg2S NWs is driven by eﬃcient C-C coupling and CO retention during CO2 electroreduction. DFT calculations also demonstrate that the high ethanol se- lectivity of AgAg2S NWs arises from a more favorable reaction pathway. The ﬁrst step is the activation of adsorbed CO2, forming CO2 , and then CO2 couples with a proton to form COOH and the following intermediates. Energy barriers for these steps are lower on AgAg2S NWs, indicating the formation and proto- nation of CO2 are easier at the AgAg2S interface Figure 4d. The formation of CO on Ag NWs was calculated to be thermody- namically favorable as well although it is weaker, but CO was de- tected only on AgAg2S NWs in SERS experiments. This error be- tween DFT calculations and SERS experiments may be because of the surface concentration of COOH.6,28 The energy barrier of CO2 protonation to COOH was calculated to be much easier on AgAg2S NWs 0.21 eV than Ag NWs 0.01",

Water, serving as a proton source in aqueous solution, plays a pivotal role in the protonation of intermediates. However, the detailed structure and its speciﬁc role in CO2 electroreduction remain to be elucidated. To in- vestigate these, the O-H stretching vibrations of water were detected by EC-SERS and analyzed through Gaussian ﬁtting Figure 5a,b; Figure S26 and Table S3, Supporting Informa- tion.

The role of hydrogen bonding in modulating HER is eluci- dated mainly through the behavior of 4H-H2O and 2H-H2O.

In comparison, 2H-H2O on AgAg2S NWs occupies a lower proportion and is less sensitive than K-H2O Figure 5f, suggesting that the surface composition and struc- ture of AgAg2S NWs inﬂuence the distribution and behavior of interfacial water in a way that reduces the activity of HER. The presence of K-H2O and interfacial K concentration is critical for CO2 electroreduction. On Ag NWs, K-H2O emerges at potentials below 0.75 V Figure 5c, which is attributed to the electrostatic migration of K for charge compensation.48 In contrast, K-H2O is observed across a broader potential range on AgAg2S NWs. It is due to both the electrostatic migration and speciﬁc adsorption of cations driven by interfacial electric ﬁeld strength brought by the negatively charged Ag2S Figures S27, Supporting Information. The elevated K concentration on AgAg2S NWs leads to a competitive adsorption environment, where K and protons compete for adsorption sites, further Adv.

This coordination occurs as K desolvates and partially replaces the hydrogen-bonding sta- bilization of interfacial water.50 The highest Stark slope of K- H2O on AgAg2S NWs indicates that K-H2O induced by sulfur- ization responds more rapidly to an applied electric ﬁeld, thereby facilitating its participation in the reaction and amplifying the K eﬀect. Computational results further reveal that the water adsorp- tion and dissociation energies on AgAg2S NWs are lower than those on Ag NWs Figure S28, Supporting Information, suggest- ing a more abundant proton supply and promoted protonation of intermediates.

Thus, the enhanced ethanol selectivity on AgAg2S NWs can be attributed to both the K eﬀect, which promotes CO2 activation and C-C coupling, and the easier protonation of intermediates. Operando EC-SERS and DFT calculations reveal the mech- anism of enhanced ethanol selectivity on AgAg2S NWs. Operando EC-SERS detects COOH, CO and CH2CHO on AgAg2S NWs, showing the high coverage of CO and the high tendency for CO2 to convert to ethanol. DFT calculations prove the reduced energy barriers of CO2 activation, water dissociation, protonation, and C-C coupling by sulfurization. Analysis of in- terfacial water structures ﬁnds that the superior CO2 electrore- duction activity and higher ethanol selectivity of AgAg2S NWs come from the lower adsorption and dissociation energies of wa- ter on AgAg2S NWs, suppressed HER due to hydrogen bonding, along with easier protonation and C-C coupling is driven by K eﬀect. 3. Conclusion In conclusion, interfacial water structures along with carbona- ceous intermediates revealed the underlying mechanisms for enhanced ethanol selectivity and stability for CO2 electrore- duction on AgAg2S NWs. Optimized AgAg2S heterointerface from controlled sulfurization resulted in the unique electronic structure of the lowest Ag 3d binding energy as detected by XPS, which further provided the optimum adsorption sites for the intermediates and interfacial water to form ethanol. The ethanol FE of 75 at 0.95 V is achieved on such an opti- mum AgAg2S interface. Operando EC-SERS combined with DFT calculations proved that the enhanced ethanol selectivity originated from facilitated C-C coupling driven by high CO coverage, lower energy barrier, and K eﬀect induced by sul- furization. Dynamic interfacial water behavior also accounts for lower adsorption and dissociation energies of water, sup- pressed HER, and easier protonation facilitating ethanol forma- tion on Ag Ag2S NWs. Therefore, operando EC-SERS com- bined with DFT calculations eﬀectively explained the remark- able ethanol selectivity from AgAg2S NWs. This study not only establishes a rational atomic interface design for steer- ing ethanol formation but also elucidates the dynamic inter- play between catalyst electronic structure and interfacial species, oﬀering a molecular-level roadmap for advanced CO2 conversion systems.

In this study, we describe a new and efﬁcient catalyst system, C60 fullerenolamine FA-modiﬁed Pd metallene Pdene, and demonstrate that the FA molecules not only increase the active sites availability but also exert an electronic effect that enhances the catalytic performance of Pdene in alcohol oxidation reactions. Speciﬁcally, FA increases the electrochemical active surface area through dispersion, while its electron-withdrawing characteristics induce an electron-deﬁcient surface on Pdene, which facilitates the adsorption of electron-rich intermediates OH and the desorption of electron-deﬁcient poisonous intermediates CO. The practical signiﬁcance of this modiﬁcation is demonstrated by achieving a 54.5 increase in mass activity and 46.3 enhancement in speciﬁc activity for ethanol oxidation relative to Pdene. Beyond these improvements, the FA-Pdene catalyst demonstrates exceptional operational stability, superior CO poisoning resistance, and enhanced C1 pathway selectivity. An in-depth analysis utilizing in-situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, coupled with density functional theory calculations, offers valuable insights into how the FA ligand modulates the mechanistic pathways involved in ethanol oxidation processes. This fullerene-mediated catalytic effect could hold the key to unlocking the potential of the metal-based system. Introduction The rapid consumption of fossil fuels and the resulting degradation of the environment have sparked a drive to develop efﬁcient electrochemical energy conversion tech- nologies. Direct alcohol fuel cells DAFCs have garnered considerable attention owing to their high energy densities, ease of storage and transportation, as well as the widespread availability of raw materials.1 Despite their promise as fuel sources, the electrooxidation process of alcohols presents signiﬁcant challenges due to the sluggish kinetics resulting from the complex multi-electron transfer processes involved.

The emerging two-dimensional 2D metallenes present a promising solution through their unique structural advantages.4,5 For example, metallene exhibits a high speciﬁc surface area, high atomic utilization and remarkable unsaturated metal sites, which can provide more active sites for catalytic reactions, thereby signiﬁcantly enhancing catalytic activity.6 However, the high surface energy of metallenes renders them susceptible to interlayer stacking during catalytic reactions, leading to a substantial loss of active sites and subsequent performance degradation.7 Consequently, to enhance the catalytic performance of metallenes, two complementary strategies need to be adopted: 1 achieving high dispersion of metallenes to maximize active site availability, and 2 engineering the electronic properties of metallenes through advanced material design to achieve optimal catalytic properties. Notably, strategies such as defect engineering, interface engineering, pore engineering, doping, and alloying have been successfully utilized to either enhance the density of active sites or modulate the electronic structures of metallenes. These optimizations have markedly improved their catalytic performance in reactions such as hydrogen Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2025, e202506044 1 of 10 2025 Wiley-VCH GmbH Research Article evolution,8,9 nitrate reduction,10,11 oxygen reduction,12,13 and alcohol oxidation reactions.14 Nevertheless, the strategic application of ligand modiﬁcation to enhance the catalytic activity and stability of metallenes, particularly for alcohol oxidation reactions, has received far less attention and remains largely unexplored. Consequently, employing a post-modiﬁcation approach, which is particularly beneﬁcial due to its minimal impact on the morphology of Pd metallene Pdene, to functionalize the Pdene surface with ligands presents signiﬁcant potential for tailoring its electronic properties and gaining a more profound insight into the impact of ligands on catalytic performance. However, it is important to acknowledge that while attaching ligands to metal surfaces can induce unique electronic effects, such modiﬁcations will inevitably result in partial coverage of the metal surface. This in turn, reduces the number of active sites available and may hinder the access of reactants to the catalytic sites.15,16 Therefore, considering the critical importance of surface site availability and electronic properties, developing ligands that integrate these properties presents a promising approach to enhance catalytic performance, although it is a signiﬁcant challenge. Fullerenes and their derivatives, as spherical molecu- lar carbon with π-conjugated surfaces, possess exceptional abilities in electron buffering and charge transportation, offering signiﬁcant potential to exert electronic effects on heterogeneous metal catalysts. For example, C60 fullerene is capable of stabilizing the metastable active Cu species in a CuSiO2 catalyst through electron donation-acceptance interactions, facilitating the ambient-pressure hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate to ethylene glycol.17 Depositing a C60 layer onto the transition metal substrates balances the electron density at catalytic transition metal sites, promoting the activation of nitrogen for ammonia synthesis.18 Loading PtRu sites onto C60 or hydroxylated C60 can enhance their",

In this article, we describe the creation of a fullereno- lamine FA-modiﬁed Pd metallene catalyst FA-Pdene, which exhibits enhanced activity, stability, CO resistance, and C1 selectivity for enthanol oxidation reactions. The FA mod- iﬁcation not only increases the availability of active sites but also creates electron-deﬁcient Pd surfaces. Such an electronic state favors the adsorption of electron-rich intermediates OH while disfavoring the adsorption of electron-deﬁcient poisonous intermediate CO, thereby signiﬁcantly boosting the catalytic performance of FA-Pdene for the oxidation of ethanol, methanol and ethylene glycol. This work not only highlights the potential of fullerene modiﬁers in promoting alcohol oxidation reactions but also opens a new avenue for the surface modiﬁcation of metallenes. Results and discussion Synthesis and Characterization of FA-Pdene FA-Pdene was prepared through a simple two-step process Figure 1a. In brief, the reaction between Pdacac2 and WCO6 acting as a reducing and structure-directing agent resulted in the formation of Pdene under moderate reduction conditions at 50 C.12 Then, fullerenolamine FA, featuring multiple amine NH2 and hydroxyl OH groups attached to the C60 cage,23 was introduced to the aqueous dispersion of Pdene while stirring Figure 1a. During this process, the Pdene coordinated with the FA molecules, leading to the formation of FA-modiﬁed Pdene catalysts FA-Pdene. Con- sidering the presence of both NH2 and OH groups on C60, we performed a control experiment to explore which group is primarily responsible for the interaction between Pdene and C60. Thus, C60OH24 was also synthesized24 and utilized in lieu of FA to synthesize C60OH24-Pdene, following the same procedures that were implemented for the preparation of FA-Pdene. As depicted in Figure S1a, C60OH24-Pdene exhibited signiﬁcant precipitation after 2 h. By the end of a 12 h period, the precipitate had completely settled to the bottom, leaving the supernatant with the distinctive brown color of C60OH24. This observation suggests that C60OH24 does not effectively interact with Pdene, as indicated by the comparable electrochemical surface area ECSA Figure S1b,c. This experiment shows the importance of the NH2 groups to modify the surface of Pdene. For controlled comparison, an organic fatty amine with electron-donating properties, namely ethylenediamine EDA was also selected to modify Pdene. EDA-Pdene was synthesized using the same procedure. Once FA is added to the Pdene dispersion, the solution dis- plays remarkable dispersibility which can be clearly observed with the naked eye, signifying a strong interaction between FA and the Pdene surface.

Once FA is added to the Pdene dispersion, the solution dis- plays remarkable dispersibility which can be clearly observed with the naked eye, signifying a strong interaction between FA and the Pdene surface. Moreover, the presence of FA enhances the stability of FA-Pdene, allowing it to maintain excellent dispersibility even after being stored for 12 h. In contrast, Pdene and EDA-Pdene exhibit signiﬁcant sedimen- tation Figure S2. Good dispersibility is advantageous as it exposes more of the Pdene surface area, maximizing the availability of catalytic sites, and consequently improving the catalytic activity. The morphologies and microstructures of the prepared Pdene and FA-Pdene were characterized by transmission electron microscopy TEM. As shown in Figures 1b and S3, they both display a wrinkled 2D nanosheet structure. The post-synthesis approach e.g., adding FA subsequent to the synthesis of Pdene employed for FA-Pdene has little effect on their morphology. As shown in Figure 1ce, the HR-TEM images of FA-Pdene reveal the coexistence of crystalline and amorphous domains within the layer, and the dominant exposed surface in the crystalline domain is the Pd 111 facet, characterized by a lattice spacing of 0.22 nm Figure 1e. These results are in agreement with the observations recorded for Pdene in Figure S3d, further indicating that there is very Angew. Chem. Int.

This distribution veriﬁes the successful attachment of FA onto the surface of Pdene, given that FA is mainly responsible for the elemental CNO content. The relative amounts of C, N, O, and Pd are 28.29, 1.42, 3.13 and 67.16 wt, respectively Figure S4 and Table S1. Powder X-ray diffraction PXRD was conducted to investigate the crystalline structure characteristics of the catalysts Figure 2a. In the XRD pattern of the comparison sample, PdC, the diffraction peaks corresponding to C 002, Pd 111, Pd 200, Pd 220, and Pd 311 PDF 461043 are observed. Pdene and FA-Pdene exhibit XRD patterns that are similar to that of PdC. By comparison, it can be found that the peak intensity of FA-Pdene decreases, which is attributed to the coverage with the non-crystalline FA on the surface of Pdene. The successful modiﬁcation was further conﬁrmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy FTIR Figure 2b. The spectrum of pure FA shows two broad peaks located around 3426 and 3140 cm1, which are ascribed to stretching vibrations of OH v OH and NH v NH bonds, respectively. The intense absorption peak at 1608 cm1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of the CO bond v CO, and the vibrations observed at 1398 and 1105 cm1 originate from scissoring vibrations of C-O-H δs COH and the stretching vibration of CO v CO, respectively.23 These spectral features conﬁrm the successful attachment of amino NH2 and hydroxyl OH groups to C60. In the spectrum of pure Pdene, no discernible absorption peaks are observed due to its metallic nature. In contrast, FA-Pdene exhibits distinct characteristic absorption peaks for FA at Angew. Chem.

As shown in Figure 2c, the survey spectrum of FA- Pdene displays peaks at 284.8, 335.7, 400.0, and 532.5 eV, corresponding to the binding energies of C 1s, Pd 3d, N 1s and O 1s, respectively.25 Notably, FA is the principal sources of the N element, therefore, the presence of the N element in the samples conﬁrms the successful introduction of FA onto Pdene. The content of each element, calculated based on XPS analysis, is summarized in Table S2. In the high- resolution C 1s XPS spectra of FA-Pdene Figure 2d, the peaks centered at 289.1, 287.8, 286.4, and 284.8 eV correspond to the binding energies of -COOH, CO CN, COC, and CC CC, respectively. In the N 1s spectrum, peaks with binding energies of 401.8, 400.3, and 398.3 eV are ascribed to NH3, CN from the CNH2 group and NH from the CNH2 group, respectively Figure 2e.23 The high resolution Pd 3d XPS spectra of Pdene and FA- Pdene reveal two pairs of well-deﬁned peaks Figure 2f. The red peaks correspond to Pd0 3d32Pd0 3d52, due to the metallic state of Pd, while the blue peaks correspond to Pd2 3d32Pd2 3d52, due to the oxidized Pd.25 The observation of Pd2 in the XPS spectra is attributed to the surface oxidation of Pd. Compared with Pdene, the binding energy for Pd0 in FA-Pdene undergoes a shift of 0.2 eV toward higher binding energy, indicating a strong interaction between FA and Pdene, leading to charge transfer from Pdene to FA. X-ray absorption near edge structure XANES spectra and Fourier transform extended X-ray absorption ﬁne struc- ture FT-EXAFS spectra were acquired to explore the local electronic structure and coordination environment of the Pd species in FA-Pdene. From the XANES spectra Figure 3a, the Pd K-edge position for FA-Pdene is very close to that of the Pd foil, but far from that of the PdO reference. This indicates that the valence state of Pd in FA-Pdene is near to zero, consistent with the XPS results. The local chemical environment of Pd atoms in FA-Pdene was analyzed through FT-EXAFS Figure 3b,c and wavelet transform diagrams Figure 3df. As shown in Figure 3b, the peaks located at 1.58 and 2.48 Å are associated with the PdN and Pd Pd scattering pairs, respectively. Based on this observation, it can be deduced that FA and the Pdene substrate are bridged through N-atoms. In addition, the PdPd distance 2.48 A in FA-Pdene is shorter than that for Pd foil 2.51 A, implying a compressive strain induced by the 2D nature of the metallene.26 According to the relevant FT-EXAFS spectrum of the Pd K-edge ﬁtting results Figure 3c, the coordination number for PdPd and PdN in FA-Pdene are 6.2 and 2.5, respectively.

As displayed in Figure 4a, a distinct reduction peak appears between 0.50 and 0.30 V versus SCE for all the tested catalysts, signifying the reduction of PdO to Pd. Further comparison reveals that the PdO reduction peak of FA-Pdene, which occurs at -0.36 V, is more positive compared to that of Pdene 0.38 V and PdC 0.40 V. This positive shift implies that the oxygen species on the catalyst surface can be removed more easily, favoring the recovery of the Pd active sites.27 The ECSA of the three catalysts was calculated by integrating the area of the PdO reduction peak, and the results are summarized in Figure 4b. It exhibits that FA-Pdene possesses the largest ECSA value 345.7 cm2 mgPd1, as compared with Pdene 325.9 cm2 mgPd1 and PdC 242.0 cm2 mgPd1. The incorporation of FA enhances ECSA by increasing the accessibility of active surface sites, instead of diminishing the active area through site coverage. This improvement primarily arises from the hydrophilic spherical FA molecules, which enabe the Pdene to disperse well, effectively preventing the aggregation of 2D Pd nanosheets and maximizing the exposure of the catalytically active surfaces. The electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation reaction EOR properties of the catalysts were evaluated in 1.0 M KOH 1.0 M ethanol solution. Initially, the impact of the FA dosage on activity was examined through CV experiments. The results reveal that FA-Pdene synthesized with 4 mg of FA exhibits a higher ECSA and superior performance compared to FA-Pdene synthesized using 2 or 6 mg of FA Figure S7. This ﬁnding indicates that FA addition amount is crucial to achieve a balance between maximizing accessible active sites and optimizing the electronic properties of Pd.

In addition, the onset oxi- dation potential of ethanol Eethanol, O for FA-Pdene shifts negatively by 36 and 106 mV as compared with Pdene and PdC catalysts, respectively, showing that FA-Pdene exhibits the highest activity for EOR Figure S8. To assess the intrinsic activity of the catalysts, the oxidative current in the forward scan was normalized by the mass loading of Pd and the ECSA on the electrode to obtain the mass activity and speciﬁc activity, respectively. The results presented in Figure 4d shows that FA-Pdene exhibits a mass activity of 4123.0 mA mgPd1, which is 1.5 and 7.1 folds higher than that of Pdene 2669.2 mA mgPd1 and commercial PdC 583.0 mA mgPd1.

Clearly, FA-Pdene exhibits a lower charge transfer resistance Rct, 76.5 compared to Pdene Rct, 85.5 and PdC Rct, 580.3 . The observed reduction in charge transfer resistance Rct in FA-Pdene highlights the easier and faster charge transfer, as well as more favorable electrocatalytic reaction kinetics.9 This enhancement can be attributed to the PdNH2C60 interaction, which facilitates the electron transfer during the electrochemical EOR process.

The kinetics of EOR on FA- Pdene was further analyzed through CV measurements at scanning rates varying from 50 to 200 mV s1 in a solution containing 1.0 M KOH 1.0 M ethanol Figure S9. The plot derived from these CV curves demonstrates a linear relationship between the current density j and the square root of the scan rate v12, indicating that the electrocatalytic EOR for the FA-Pdene catalyst is limited by diffusion.37 In summary, the modiﬁcation of Pdene with FA molecules promotes the kinetics of EOR and boosts the catalytic activity. Anti-poisoning performance is crucial for achieving efﬁ- cient EOR. The tolerance of FA-Pdene to CO-poisoning was investigated through CO-stripping experiments. As illustrated in the CO stripping CVs Figure 4f, FA-Pdene displays an onset potential ECO, O of -0.36 V and a peak potential of 0.25 V for CO oxidation. These potentials represent a negative shift compared to those observed for Pdene 0.31 and 0.23 V, and PdC 0.31 and 0.22 V. This indicates that the incorporation of FA effectively enhances the resis- tance of Pd to CO poisoning, which can be attributed to the electron-deﬁcient nature of the Pdene surface resulting from the electron transfer from Pd to FA. The electron-deﬁcient Pd sites weaken their interaction with the similarly electron- deﬁcient 2π antibonding orbitals of CO.38 Consequently, a lower potential is required for the desorption of CO from the Pd sites, leading to the improved resistance to CO poisoning.

As shown in the Figure S10, FA-Pdene exhibited the least mass activity loss after being supplied for CO gas for 5 min, further indicating its superior resistance to CO poisoning. Chronoamperometry CA was employed to test the long-term stability of FA-Pdene, Pdene, and PdC. From the j-t curves in Figure 4g, it is evident that all catalysts display a prompt decline in current density during the initial stage of EOR, which is due to the occupation of Pd active sites by carbonaceous poisoning species e.g., COads produced by EOR.39 After 4000 s, FA-Pdene maintains a high current density of 182.5 mA mgPd1, while the current densities of Pdene and commercial PdC were signiﬁcantly lower, at 28.7 and 2.5 mA mgPd1, respectively. This result indicates the enhanced durability of FA-Pdene. In order to investigate the deactivation mechanism of the catalyst, we test the CVs of Pdene, FA-Pdene, and PdC before CA measurements, as well as CVs after regeneration following 4000 s of CA testing. As depicted in Figure S11, FA-Pdene, Pdene, and PdC recover respectively 93.2, 88.9, and 86.2 of their corresponding original mass activity. The results strongly suggest that the deactivation process is dominated by carbonaceous intermediates poisoning. Therefore, the improvement in durability of FA-Pdene likely arises from the enhanced resistance of the catalytic interface to carbonaceous species, which contributes to the renewal of Pd active sites during the EOR process. Meanwhile, the enhanced stability of FA-Pdene can be veriﬁed by CV measurements Figures 4h and S12. After enduring 500 consecutive CV scans, the mass activity of FA-Pdene retained 30.0 of its initial value, which is notably higher compared to Pdene 15.0 and PdC 0.4. The morphological stability of FA-Pdene post EOR i.e., after 4000 s of i-t measurement was examined by TEM images and EDS elemental analysis Figures S13, S14 and Table S5. The results show that FA-Pdene retains its 2D wrinkled nanosheet structure, and there are negligible changes in the contents of each element before Table S1 and after Table S5 the stability test. To further highlight the distinct advantage of FA, we utilized ethylenediamine EDA, an organic fatty amine endowed with electron-donating properties, to modify Pdene and evaluated the EOR performance of the material. The successful modiﬁcation of Pdene by EDA was conﬁrmed through FT-IR and XPS measurements Figure S15 and Table S4, and the modiﬁcation did not affect the morphology of Pdene Figure S16. As demonstrated in the FT-IR spectrum Figure S15a, the peak located around 3250 cm1 is attributed to the absorption corresponding to the NH stretching mode, and the peaks at 1630 and 1087 cm1 are the NH bending vibration and CN stretching mode, respectively.23 The CC, NH",

As demonstrated in the FT-IR spectrum Figure S15a, the peak located around 3250 cm1 is attributed to the absorption corresponding to the NH stretching mode, and the peaks at 1630 and 1087 cm1 are the NH bending vibration and CN stretching mode, respectively.23 The CC, NH and CN bonds were also observed in the high-resolution of C 1s and N 1s XPS spectra, respectively Figure S15d,e. Notably, the XPS spectrum of Pd 3d reveals a negative shift of 0.1 eV in the Pd0 peak when compared to that of Pdene Figure S15f, indicating the electron transfer from EDA to Pd, which ultimately leads to an electron-enriched surface on Pd. This is in contrast to the results obtained with FA modiﬁcation. In addition, the modiﬁcation of Pdene by planar-structured EDA not only failed to enhance its dispersibility Figure S1 but also reduced its electrochemically active surfaces Figure S17a,b. The reduced availability of surface active sites, coupled with unfavorable alterations in the electronic structures, results in a substantial reduction in mass activity Figure S17c, resistance to CO poisoning Figure S17d and stability Figure S17e,f compared to the pristine Pdene Figure 4i. These ﬁndings emphasize the advantages of FA, particularly its unique functionality manifested through electronic modulation. Furthermore, to ascertain the universality of the FA-Pdene catalyst in alcohol oxidation reactions, experiments were conducted for the methanol oxidation reaction MOR and ethylene glycol oxidation reaction EGOR in alkaline media, using both Pdene and FA-Pdene catalysts for comparison. As depicted in Figures S18 and S19, FA-Pdene shows better activity and stability for MOR 1591.2 mA mgPd1 and EGOR 4064.2 mA mgPd1, in comparison to Pdene 1162.2 mA mgPd1 for MOR and 2584.3 mA mgPd1 for EGOR. The introduction of FA results in a well-performing catalytic surface, enhancing the alcohol oxidation properties of Pdene. Electro-Oxidation Mechanism on FA-Pdene The electrochemical EOR involves spontaneous dissociation of ethanol at lower potentials and oxidation of ethanol at higher potentials. In the EOR process, there are usually two competing oxidation pathways, namely C1 CC bonds breaking and C2 without the breaking of CC bonds. The Angew. Chem. Int.

C1 pathway involves the complete oxidation of ethanol to CO2 through a 12-electron 12e process, and the C2 path- way involves the incomplete oxidation of ethanol, resulting in the formation of acetate through a 4-electron 4e process. In-situ attenuated total reﬂection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ATR-FTIR of ethanol oxidation on the FA- Pdene and Pdene electrodes was conducted and the results are presented in Figure 5a,b. By collecting the evanescent wave signals, the evolution of reaction intermediates during the ethanol oxidation reaction was observed. Notably, the characteristic absorption band at 2337 cm1 for the FA-Pdene electrode and 2321 cm1 for the Pdene electrode correspond to the production of CO2,40 a product of the complete oxidation of ethanol. This observation indicates the presence of the C1 pathway in both cases. Additionally, the characteristic absorption bands associated with the acetate ion CH3COO are identiﬁed at 1519, 1430, and 1272 cm1 for the FA-Pdene electrode and 1538, 1436, and 1280 cm1 for the Pdene electrode, respectively.40 These ﬁndings agree with the C2 pathway. It can be observed that FA-Pdene demonstrates higher peak intensities for C1 and C2 products compared to Pdene, suggesting a higher catalytic efﬁciency during the EOR process.41 Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the vibrational signal corresponding to CO2 on the FA-Pdene electrode appears at 0.8 V, which is more negative compared to 0.7 V on the Pdene electrode, implying that the reaction energy barrier for the C1 pathway on FA-Pdene is lower than that for Pdene. Therefore, FA-Pdene exhibits advantages in efﬁciently catalyzing the cleavage of CC bonds during the EOR process, thereby promoting the C1 pathway. This can be veriﬁed by the 1H nuclear magnetic resonance NMR measurements as depicted in Figure 5ce. Based on the quantity of CH3COOK present in both cases depicted in Figure 5e, the C1 efﬁciency of FA-Pdene has been determined to be 30.1, which represents a 38.0 increase compared to the 21.8 efﬁciency of Pdene. DFT Analysis Density functional theory DFT calculations were performed to reveal the impacts of surface FA and EDA molecules on the electrocatalytic EOR process. The optimized atomic structure models of FA-Pdene The functionalization positions of NH2 and OH groups on C60 were arbitrarily selected and EDA-Pdene used for calculations are illustrated in Figure 6a,b. In the model for FA-Pdene, the diameter of FA was approximately 1.2 nm, which is consistent with the AFM test results. The FA and EDA molecules are bound to the Angew. Chem. Int.

As depicted in Figure 6a,b, the electron density difference maps reveal distinct disparity of the charge distribution between FA-Pdene and EDA-Pdene. In the case of FA-Pdene, the map shows electron enrichment indicated by yellow at the base of the FA molecule and electron depletion indicated by blue at the upper surface of Pdene, indicating electron transfer from the surface of Pdene to the FA molecule. The electron deﬁciency on the surface of Pdene can produce an extra positive potential, which favors the oxidation of ethanol.42 In addition, as the 2π orbital of CO is also electron-deﬁcient, the adsorption of CO onto FA-Pdene is decreased. Consequently, FA-Pdene exhibits enhanced resistance to CO poisoning, as evidenced by the negative shift in both the onset and peak potentials during CO stripping Figure 4f. On the contrary, EDA transfers electron density to the Pdene surface Figure 6b, thereby enhancing the afﬁnity of Pdene for CO and diminishing its resistance to poisoning. In addition, the adsorption energies of key reaction intermediates involved in the EOR process, namely OH, CO, and CH3CO were analyzed on the surface of Pdene, FA-Pdene and EDA-Pdene Figure S20. As displayed in Figure 6c, compared with Pdene Ead 2.62 eV and EDA- Pdene Ead 2.45 eV, FA-Pdene exhibits the strongest adsorption for OH Ead 2.78 eV. This heightened adsorption can be attributed to the generation of hydrogen bonds between the NH2OH groups and OH.43 The pref- erential adsorption of OH on FA-Pdene facilitates the oxida- tion and removal of CO. Even more advantageous, FA-Pdene exhibits the lowest adsorption capacity for CO in comparison to Pdene and EDA-Pdene Figure 6d, highlighting its enhanced resistance to CO poisoning. This advantageous property is attributed to the formation of an electron-deﬁcient Pd surface on FA-Pdene. In the context of the EOR process, it is commonly accepted that the selectivity between the C1 and C2 pathways depends on whether CH3CO undergoes dehy- drogenation to form CH2CO for subsequent dissociation or oxidation to produce CH3COOH. Speciﬁcally, enhancing the adsorption of CH3CO can promote its dissociation, whereas weakening its adsorption favors the removal of CH3CO in its C2 form without undergoing CC dissociation. After introducing FA onto Pdene, the adsorption of CH3CO is enhanced Figure 6e, which favors the C1 pathway. Conclusions In summary, the hydrophilic spherical FA molecules with electron-withdrawing properties not only effectively disperse Pdene, it also affects the electronics of the Pd active sites.

Surface modiﬁcation of metal catalysts through the use of molecules with distinct electronic and spatial effects offers promising opportunities for creating highly effective catalytic interfaces tailored for speciﬁc reactions.

Introduction Ammonia NH3 plays an extremely important role in modern society, which is the raw material for the manufacture of nitrogen fertilizer, nitrogen-containing medicines, polymer materials, dyes and so on.13 The global annual ammonia production has reached 235 million tons in 2019.4 Up to now, industrial ammonia synthesis heavily relies on the century-old Haber-Bosch process, in which nitrogen N2 and hydrogen H2 are reacted to NH3 using Fe-base material as a catalyst at harsh conditions temperature 400500 C, pressure 150300 atm. Due to the harsh conditions and the huge ammonia production in the world, NH3 synthesis industry consumes about 1-2 of the global annual energy demand, accounting for about 1 of the carbon dioxide CO2 emission.5,6 Hence, it is very urgent to develop a green, sustainable and energy-saving ammonia synthesis technology to partially replace the Haber-Bosch process. Electricity driven nitrates reduction reaction NO3RR is regarded as a powerful complement to the traditional Haber-Bosch process toward large-scale ammonia synthesis. Benefitting from the extremely high solubility of the nitrate ions, and relative low bond energy of NO 204 kJ mol1, the ammonia generation kinetics of NO3RR is increased by 3-4 orders of magnitude with relatively low energy input in comparison to the fascinating nitrogen reduction reaction NRR.716 Moreover, nitrates are widely existed in nature, mainly derived from industrial wastewater, domestic sewage, livestock manure and nuclear industry wastewater.17 Beyond that, NO3RR possesses high equilibrium potential of 0.69 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode RHE, higher than that of the oxygen reduction reaction ORR, 0.4 V in Znairoxygen batteries.18,19 As such, integrating of NO3RR as a cathode coupled with zinc oxidation as an anode to assemble zinc-nitrate battery, can achieve the goal of one stone and three birds, namely the removal of nitrates, obtaining valuable ammonia and outputting electrical energy.2023 However, the current electrochemical NO3-to-NH3 conversion is still restricted by the low NH3 yield rate and Faradaic efficiency FE. 10.1002anie.202509303 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.",

Currently, various strategies, including alloying,12,20 heteroatom doping,18 heterojunction,11,22 defect engineering23 have been put forward, aiming to reduce the energy barrier of the rate-determining step RDS of NO3RR.24 Nevertheless, the influence of the energy barriers of the non-RDSs in NO3RR on the overall performance was ignored. Inspired by the water flow process in nature, which always spontaneously experiences the lowest energy path, the overall NO3RR performance is bound to be optimal if each elementary step also undergoes the lowest energy barrier. For the multi-intermediates and multi-steps involved reduction process, multiple active centers nor single active center are essential to achieve the lowest energy barrier required for each conversion step as much as possible.25 Here, we put forward a novel continuous intermediates spillover strategy to enhance proton-coupled electron transfer process by constructing dual single-atom molybdenum Mo1 and iron Fe1 alloy metallene. Previous reports have confirmed that Mo and Fe single-atom sites could achieve the tandem NO3RR, which achieved high NH3 FE.26,27 In addition, the Pd metallene was chosen as the carrier due to the high specific surface area, tunable electronic structure, which endowed high electrochemical performance in catalysis.28 The atomically dispersed Mo and Fe atoms in Pd matrix facilitated N-intermediates hop back and forth between Mo and Fe sites in searching of the lower energy barrier for each elementary step, which was confirmed by in situ spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations. Beyond that, atomic Mo and Fe doping regulated the interfacial water network structure to inhibit the too fast water splitting kinetics, which synchronously guaranteed high NH3 yield rate and FE. As a result, the synthesized dual single-atom alloy metallene displayed greatly enhanced NH3 yield rate and NH3 FE compared with that of the counterpart metallenes. 10.1002anie.202509303 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

Carbon monoxide CO molecules in situ released from Fe2CO9 and MoCO6 adsorbed tightly on Pd-rich alloy surface, which resulted in the formation of ultrathin Pd-rich nanosheet, i.e., Pd-rich trimetallene, denotes as Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene.28 As a control, atomically dispersed iron Fe1Pd or molybdenum Mo1Pd atoms bimetallenes, and Pd metallene were synthesized with a similar synthetic process Figures S1 and S2. Powder X-ray diffraction XRD patterns show that both Mo1Fe1Pd and the control samples possess face-centered cubic fcc structure, consistent with that of fcc Pd JCPDS no. 46-1043, Figure 1b. As determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry ICP-MS, the molar ratios of Pd, Fe and Mo were 90:8:2. Transmission electron microscopy TEM and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM HAADF-STEM images reveal that the sample is dominated by ultrathin nanosheet structure Figures 1c and S1a with average lateral size of about 100-200 nm. The thickness of the trimetallene is only 1.8 nm, determined by atomic force microscopy AFM measurement Figure 1d, coincided with the result determined by TEM characterization the insert in Figure 1c, further confirming the metallene structure. Atomic-resolution aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM image Figure 1e displays clear two-dimensional atom arrangement with a lattice distance of 0.195 nm at the edge of the metallene, assigning to the 100 plane of Mo1Fe1Pd. EDS elemental mapping images in Figure 1f demonstrate the uniform distribution of Mo, Fe and Pd across the entire metallene, further verifying the trimetallic alloy structure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS result of Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene indicates that Mo 3d spectrum Figure 1g displays two pairs of peaks with binding energy located at 227.2, 229.7 eV and 232.5, 235.8 eV, assigning to 3d52 and 3d32 10.1002anie.202509303 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

To decode the exact fine structure of molybdenum and iron elements in the sample, Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene sample was further characterized by synchrotron radiation-based X-ray absorption fine structure XAFS spectroscopy. Figure 2a shows Mo K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure XANES spectroscopy in reference with Mo foil and MoO2.

MoPd 2.72 Å and MoFe 2.50 Å bonds were resolved in the first shell with a coordination number CN of 3.7 and 1.7, respectively. The fine structure was further confirmed by fitting the k3-weighted Fourier transformed EXAFS spectra and k space results Figures S4a and S5a. The results indicate that Mo atoms are atomically dispersed in PdFe alloy matrix. Figure 2c and 2d shows the Fe K-edge XANES and EXAFS spectra of Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene sample in comparison to Fe foil and FeO, respectively. Similar to Mo case, FeFe bonds were absent, and PdFe bond length 2.80 Å, CN 1.6 and FeO bonds bond length 1.96 Å, CN 3.1 were resolved. The results suggest that Fe is also atomically dispersed in PdMo alloy lattice.

Putting together the above results, we conclude that Mo and Fe atoms are atomically dispersed in Pd-rich alloy lattice, namely dual single-atom Mo and Fe alloy. Electrochemical NO3RR performance of Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene was evaluated in an H-type cell using a typical three-electrode system at room temperature. Linear sweep voltammetry LSV tests were firstly performed in the mixture solution of KOH and KNO3 to assess the current response. As shown in Figure 3a, the onset potential for Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene is positively shifted from 0.32 Pd metallene, 0.43 Fe1Pd bimetallene, 0.48 Mo1Pd bimetallene to 0.55 V versus RHE, suggesting that Mo1Fe1Pd is more active in NO3RR. As expected, the current density in NO3RR of Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene is obvious higher than that of Mo1Pd, Fe1Pd bimetallenes, and Pd metallene. The results indicate that alloying dual single-atom Mo and Fe in Pd lattice indeed strengthens NO3RR performance of Pd metallene. Notably, the synergistic effect of dual single-atom Mo and Fe atoms",

The results indicate that alloying dual single-atom Mo and Fe in Pd lattice indeed strengthens NO3RR performance of Pd metallene. Notably, the synergistic effect of dual single-atom Mo and Fe atoms doping for NO3RR was confirmed by altering Mo and Fe contents in Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene Figures S6 and S7, and discussed in detail in the following section. Upon confirming the optimal Mo and Fe content, potential-dependent ammonia yield rates Figures 3b, S8 and ammonia FEs Figure 3c were obtained after electrolysis at the fixed potentials. Obviously, NH3 yield rates and NH3 FEs all gradually increased as the applied potentials negatively shifted from 0.1 to 0.7 V versus RHE for all the samples. Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene delivered much higher NH3 yield rates than that of Fe1Pd, Mo1Pd bimetallenes, and Pd metallene samples over the entire potential range. The maximum NH3 yield rate of Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene reached 13.4 mol gcat.1 h1 at 0.7 V, which was about 4.8- and 1.5-fold higher than that of Pd metallene 2.8 mol gcat.1 h1 and Fe1Pd bimetallene 9.1 mol gcat.1 h1, respectively. Consistent with the activity, NH3 FEs of Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene all surpassed Fe1Pd, Mo1Pd bimetallenes, and Pd metallene in the potential range of 0.1 to 0.7 V.

To confirm the accuracy of the above NH3 quantitative results, the yielded NH3 in the electrolyte was further spectrographically quantified with indophenol blue assay, and the results are consistent Figure S12. In industrial scenarios, durability is an important parameter for catalyst assessment. In H-type cell, Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene could sustain continuous thirty cycles at 0.7 V, NH3 yield rates and NH3 FEs were stable without obvious activity decay Figure S13. To further assess the stability, the catalyst was further characterized by XRD pattern and TEM measurement after durability test. The crystal structure and the morphology of the Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene were well maintained Figure S14.

Then, 15N isotope labeling experiment was carried out to confirm that the produced NH3 was really rooted from NO3RR, not contamination from nitrogenous precursors Figure 3g. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum 1H-NMR of the electrolyte shows a double peak between 7.1-7.4 ppm with a coupling constant of 72 Hz using K15NO3 as N-resource, the characteristic signal of 15NH4.33 As a control, a triplet peak with a coupling constant of 52 Hz arise in 1H-NMR spectrum with K14NO3 as N-feeding. The above result irrefutably confirms the yielded NH3 indeed come from NO3RR. Moreover, Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene delivers excellent NO3RR performance in a wide range of NO3 concentrations Figure 3h and pH Figure S19. In the field, the direct conversion of nitrates in wastewater into ammonia to provide nitrogen source for crops is the most direct way for nitrogen cycle. Using solar power to drive the above device can not only reduce the cost of electricity, but also realize the self-driven sustainable operation of ammonia synthesis. This requires the stable operation of the electrolyzer over a wide voltage range. Under this scenario, we further simulated the ammonia production by electrolysis of nitrates driven by solar energy Figure S20. A commercial silicon solar panel 1.9 W illuminated by xenon lamp 100 mW cm2 was employed to power ammonia electrosynthesis using Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene as a catalyst in the wild environment. As",

As expected, the yielded NH3 amounts showed a linear relationship with the illumination time, and an average NH3 yield rate reached 2.96 mol gcat.1 h1, demonstrating the potential application prospects. Upon assessing the NO3RR performance, it is essential to decode the specific role of Mo and Fe dual single-atom alloy in ammonia electrosynthesis. Generally, NO3RR usually follows 10.1002anie.202509303 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

Figure 4a-4c shows the potential-dependent partial current densities of NO2 jNO2, ammonia jNH3 and HER jH2 for Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene in comparison to Fe1Pd, Mo1Pd bimetallenes, and Pd metallene, respectively Figure S21. For NO3NO2 conversion, the jNO2 arranges as follow: Mo1Pd Pd Fe1Pd Mo1Fe1Pd Figure 4a. In contrast, the jNH3 is listed as Mo1Fe1Pd Fe1Pd Mo1Pd Pd. By comparing the results of Fe1Pd, Mo1Pd and Pd samples, it is concluded that alloying single-atom Mo in Pd matrix greatly enhances jNO2, while single-atom Fe in Pd lattice increases jNH3 and weakens jNO2. Considering the promotion effect of single-atom Mo and Fe on process i and ii, alloying dual single-atom Mo and Fe in Pd lattice may cascade NO3NO2 by Mo and NO2NH3 by Fe processes in NO3RR. The above supposition was verified by the smallest jNO2 and the largest jNH3 of Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene. As a major side reaction, water splitting process not only releases hydrogen, but also provides active hydrogen H atoms. As nine H are involved in NO3RR, therefore the kinetics of water splitting greatly determines the final NH3 yield rate and NH3 FE, especially in the more negative potential area. On the one hand, the sluggish kinetics of water splitting process is not enough to provide sufficient H for the subsequent deoxyreduction processes, resulting in weakened NH3 yield rate. However, the too fast kinetics of water splitting boosts H formation and aggravates HER, leading to an awful NH3 FE. The trade-off water splitting activity directly determines NH3 yield rate and NH3 FE. As shown in Figure 4c, jH2 is declined for Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene in comparison to Fe1Pd bimetallene and Pd metallene, comparable with that of Mo1Pd bimetallene. The possible reason may be due to the regulated MH MPd, Mo, Fe bond strength after alloying",

As a result, the N-selectivity of NH3 was greatly enhanced, and NO2 was completely suppressed for Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene Figure S22. Beyond that, the chemical redox reaction of Pd and NO3 also contributed the NO2 formation in NO3RR, similar with the role of single-atom Mo. The oxidized Pd species was further reduced to metallic Pd in the operation of NO3RR Figures S23-S25.37 Based on the above analysis, the detailed mechanism of dual single-atom Mo and Fe in Pd for NO3RR was summarized in Figure S26. Moreover, electrochemical active surface area ECSA was also obtained, Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene delivered a higher ECSA than that of Mo1Pd, Fe1Pd bimetallenes, and Pd metallene, which also contributed to the enhanced NO3RR performance Figure S27. To further investigate why the single-atom Mo and Fe sites can cascade NO3RR, in situ spectroscopic characterizations were carried out to clarify the reaction pathway. Potential-dependent in situ attenuated total reflection flourier transform infrared spectroscopy ATR-FTIR measurements were conducted both for Mo1Fe1Pd, Mo1Pd, Fe1Pd samples. Figure 4d-4f shows the potential-resolved ATR-FTIR spectra in NO3RR from 0 to 0.9 V V versus RHE of Mo1Fe1Pd, Fe1Pd and Mo1Pd samples, respectively. As shown in Figure 4d, the signal of NO3 and NO2 located at 1193 and 1230 cm1 was emerged at 0.1 V, indicating the conversion of NO3 to NO2.38,39 Then, three obvious vibration peaks located at 1010, 1082 and 1340 cm1 arose at 0.2 V, which were attributed to ρasNH2, νNO and νNH4, respectively, suggesting the formation of NH3.3941 Compared with NO2, the intensity of ρasNH2 and νNH4 increased sharply when the applied potential was lower than 0.35 V, suggesting the accelerated conversion of NO3-to-NH3. The result well explains the enhanced jNH3 and NH3 FE. 10.1002anie.202509303 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

The peak located at 1641 cm1 was assigned to νO-H of interfacial H2O molecule.44 The above possible pathway coincided with that of in situ Raman spectra in NO3RR Figure S28. Notably, the signal of the key intermediates was all emerged on Fe1Pd bimetallene Figure 4e, Mo1Pd bimetallene Figure 4f and Pd metallene Figure S29, suggesting the similar reaction pathway on Fe1Pd, Mo1Pd bimetallenes, and Pd metallene. That is to say dual single-atom Mo and Fe doping in Pd matrix does not change the reaction pathway of NO3RR. Moreover, it should be emphasized that Mo1Fe1Pd sample delivered higher ATR-FTIR intensity than that of Fe1Pd, Mo1Pd bimetallenes, and Pd metallene, proofing the enhanced NO3RR performance of Mo1Fe1Pd. As a stark contrast, only the signal of ρasNH2 and νNH4 with much lower intensity was observed on Pd metallene, further confirming the greatly enhanced NO3RR performance of dual single-atom Mo and Fe alloy trimetallene. In addition to the type and strength of the N-intermediates signal, it was observed the difference of the position for NO, NH2OH and NH2. Specifically, the signal of NO arose at 1439 and 1511 cm1 for Fe1Pd and Mo1Pd, respectively. While, the signal of NO was located at 1511 cm1 for Mo1Fe1Pd, coincided with that of Mo1Pd Figure 4g. As determined by XAFS results, Mo1Fe1Pd sample possesses two distinct sites, i.e., Mo and Fe sites, therefore, it is inferred that NO could be adsorbed on Mo site for Mo1Fe1Pd sample. Accordingly, the ATR-FTIR signal of NH2OH and NH2 were located at 1545 and 1010 cm1 for Mo1Fe1Pd sample, more closer to that of Mo1Pd and Fe1Pd samples, respectively. The results indicate that NH2OH could be adsorbed on Mo site, while NH2 was adsorbed on Fe site. Based on the above results, we infer that the N-intermediates occur continuous spillover between Mo and Fe sites as the hydrogenation process proceeds. Obviously, the intermediates spillover was driven 10.1002anie.202509303 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

To further investigate the role of dual single-atom Mo and Fe alloy on the water splitting, the signal of the interfacial water structure between 3000 and 3800 cm1 were truncated from the in situ ATR-FTIR spectra.45 Figure 4h and 4i shows the potential-resolved interfacial water structure signal of Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene and Fe1Pd bimetallene, respectively, which were divided into three peaks by Gaussian fitting, i.e., 4-HBH2O 3200 cm1, 2-HBH2O 3400 cm1 and KH2O 3600 cm1.46 Alloying single-atom Fe in Pd lattice facilitated the formation of KH2O due to the oxytropism of Fe element Figures S30, S31, consistent with previous results.47 As such, Fe1Pd bimetallene delivered higher ratio of KH2O signal than that of Pd metallene. Generally, KH2O improves the kinetics of water splitting reaction due to the lower activation energy, and thus more active hydrogen atoms are formed on the catalyst surface.48 The results well explain the enhanced NO3RR performance and the enlarged jH2 for Fe1Pd sample. Further alloy single-atom Mo in Fe1Pd alloy decreased the proportion of the KH2O for Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene. As a result, the fast kinetics of water cracking to produce H was decreased, accordingly, the coupling of H and H to release hydrogen was inhibited. Finally, enhanced NH3 yield rate and the approaching 100 NH3 FE were synchronously achieved for Mo1Fe1Pd sample. Density functional theory DFT calculations were performed to further investigate the intrinsic mechanism of dual single-atom Mo and Fe doping in Pd metallene Mo1Fe1Pd for NO3RR. According to the previous results, Pd metallene enclosed with 111 plane was employed as the slab.28 The optimized structural models of Fe1Pd, Mo1Pd, and Mo1Fe1Pd 10.1002anie.202509303 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

Bader charge analysis indicated electron transfer was occurred from Mo and Fe atoms to the adjacent Pd atoms for Mo1Fe1Pd, and the electronic structure was effectively regulated. Considering the complexity of the catalytic sites for Mo1Fe1Pd sample, the Gibbs free energy diagrams for NO3RR on Mo1Pd and Fe1Pd bimetallenes were firstly calculated Table S3. As shown in Figures S33-S35, the RDSs on Fe1Pd and Mo1Pd are NO H eNHO ΔGmax 0.89 eV and NH2 H e NH3 ΔGmax 1.03 eV in NO3RR, respectively. The results indicate that NO2NH3 conversion is inhibited on Mo1Pd, hence NO2 prefers to be obtained. In contrast, the energy barrier of the RDS on Fe1Pd is lower than that on Mo1Pd, NO2 has a larger tendency to be converted to NH3. The above results well explain the larger jNO2 for Mo1Pd and larger jNH3 for Fe1Pd Figure 4a, 4b. Based on the above analysis, the Gibbs free",

The above results well explain the larger jNO2 for Mo1Pd and larger jNH3 for Fe1Pd Figure 4a, 4b. Based on the above analysis, the Gibbs free energy diagrams for NO3RR on Mo1Fe1Pd were further calculated. Notably, Mo and Fe sites were co-existed, energy diagrams on Mo and Fe sites for Mo1Fe1Pd Figures 5a, S36, S37, Table S3 were calculated, respectively. The RDSs are NONHO and NHOHNH2OH with energy barrier of 0.62 and 0.33 eV on Mo and Fe sites, respectively. From the above results, it is reasonably inferred that N-intermediates may experience different catalytic sites from the viewpoint of the minimum energy principle. To further support the conclusion, the adsorption energy of all the N-intermediates in NO3RR were calculated and compared. As shown in Figure 5b, NHO and NH2 intermediates prefer to adsorb on Fe site with larger adsorption energies, while the other N-intermediates tend to adsorb on Mo site in the case of coexistence of Mo and Fe sites, i.e., Mo1Fe1Pd sample. The result suggests that N-intermediates may hop back and forth between Mo and Fe sites in NO3RR. Therefore, the optimal pathway of NO3RR for Mo1Fe1Pd is achieved on alternant Mo and Fe sites, and the RDS is changed to NONHO with the ultralow ΔGmax value of 0.12 eV Figure 5c. 10.1002anie.202509303 Accepted Manuscript Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright.

Subsequently, NO is further hydrogenated to NHO and adsorbed on Fe site, followed by spillover to Mo site, and NHOH is adsorbed on Mo site. After hydrogenation of NHOH to NH2OH on Mo site, NH2OH is dehydrated and spilled over to Fe site again. Finally, NH3 is formed through one step hydrogenation and desorption processes. The reaction intermediates spill over three times between Mo and Fe sites in the entire NO3RR process, ultimately avoiding the large energy barriers of the RDS on Mo1Pd and Fe1Pd. Benefitting from the continuous intermediates spillover effect, the RDS on Mo1Fe1Pd is changed to NONHO with ultralow energy barrier of 0.12 eV, much lower than that of Mo1Pd and Fe1Pd samples. As such, electrochemical NO3RR on Mo1Fe1Pd is greatly accelerated, aligned with the partial current density results Figure 4a, 4b. To investigate the electronic structure of dual single-atom alloy metallene, projected density of states PDOS of metal valence orbitals in Fe1Pd, Mo1Pd, and Mo1Fe1Pd were calculated and compared Figure 5e.

To investigate the electronic structure of dual single-atom alloy metallene, projected density of states PDOS of metal valence orbitals in Fe1Pd, Mo1Pd, and Mo1Fe1Pd were calculated and compared Figure 5e. The results demonstrated that Mo1Pd exhibited higher d-band center εd 2.18 eV than Fe1Pd εd 2.41 eV, and the εd value of Mo1Fe1Pd was adjusted to a moderate level of 2.25 eV due to the co-doping of atomic Mo and Fe atoms, which can effectively regulate the interaction between metal active sites and the reaction intermediates. Based on the single active site, the adsorption energies of the N-intermediates exhibited obvious linear scaling relationship between Fe1Pd and Mo1Pd Figure 5f. Moreover, Mo1Pd owned stronger adsorption of intermediates compared to Fe1Pd, which was the primary reason why NH3 desorption was the RDS for Mo1Pd. The adsorption energies of the different intermediates on Fe1Pd, Mo1Pd, and Mo1Fe1Pd were compared and displayed in Figure 5g. The results suggest that dual single-atom Mo and Fe sites in Mo1Fe1Pd can break the linear adsorption of intermediates on the single active site, which plays an important role in enhancing the electrocatalytic activity for NO3RR.

In addition, the water splitting process for H supply was also calculated Figure S38, Table S4. H2OOH H process occurred on Fe1Pd111 or Fe site-Mo1Fe1Pd111 all delivered lower energy barriers than that of Mo1Pd111 and Mo site-Mo1Fe1Pd111, suggesting Fe doping in Pd matrix indeed facilitates HOH bond breakage. As a result, the kinetics of NO3RR to NH3 conversion was accordingly improved, consistent with the variation trend of the partial current density Figure 4c. The excellent NO3RR performance of Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene enables the exploration of NO3RR in a zinc-nitrate Zn-NO3 battery. A hybrid aqueous Zn-NO3 battery catalyzed by Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene was assembled combined with a Zn anode Figure 6a. The anolyte was 3 M KOH solution and the catholyte was 3 M KOH 0.5 M KNO3. The assembled Zn-NO3 battery delivered a stable open-circuit voltage OCV of 1.477 V, higher than that of Mo1Pd, Fe1Pd and Pd metallenes electrodes Figure 6b.

In brief, the well-designed battery could work consecutively as an energy-chemical output device for practical ammonia production and continuous power output. 3. Conclusions In summary, a highly efficient and durable dual single-atom Mo1Fe1Pd alloy metallene was synthesized for electrochemical nitrate conversion to ammonia. Atomically dispersed molybdenum and iron atoms in Pd lattice provided two distinct catalytic sites, enabling the continuous intermediates spillover between Mo and Fe sites. So that NO3RR experienced the lowest energy barrier for each elementary step, which was confirmed by in situ spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations. Furthermore, the co-doping of Mo and Fe atoms altered the interfacial water structure to restrain the competing HER, as well as regulated the electronic structure, resulting in high NH3 yield rate and NH3 FE synchronously. Mo1Fe1Pd trimetallene delivered a remarkable NH3 yield rate of 13.4 mol gcat.1 h1 and NH3 FE of 94.6, as well as excellent cycling stability. Moreover, the assembled zinc-nitrate battery delivered an OCV of 1.477 V, and the maximum output power density of 13.4 mW cm2. This work provides new insights into the design of efficient, selective and durable electrocatalysts for multi-steps and multi-intermediates involved electrosynthesis process from the angle of intermediates hopping effect.

Recent advancements have been concentrated to developing methods that efﬁciently capture and release CO2 or reduce base-CO2 adducts while regenerating bases for subsequent CO2 capture. In this study, we introduce an electrochemical strategy that integrates CO2 capture and conversion through a series of domino reactions initiated by the electrochemical generation of organic bases. This method involves the electrochemical deprotonation of halohydrin molecules, which generate hydrogen and halo-alkoxides that capture CO2 and spontaneously undergo intramolecular cyclization to yield cyclic carbonates. Direct and indirect Far- adaic efﬁciency of up to 100 is achieved for both hydrogen and ethylene carbonate production, demonstrating highly selective sequential capture and conversion reactions. Our system provides a scalable pathway for synthesizing various cyclic carbonates directly from diluted CO2 sources. In the pursuit of achieving net-zero emissions alongside escalating energy demands, integrating carbon capture, utilization, and storage CCUS technology into conventional fossil fuel-based energy pro- duction processes is imperative. Representative technologies such as amine scrubbing1, and CO2 hydrogenation2 rely on thermal processes for both capture and utilization. Recently, electrochemical processes have emerged as promising alternatives, offering potential advantages such as enhanced energy efﬁciency, adaptability to decentralized operations, and compatibility with renewable energy sources. Elec- trochemical processes can be adopted for both CO2 capture and conversion by designing reactions that generate bases, capable of capturing CO2 or facilitate the reduction of CO2 3. For example, the typical approach in electrochemical CO2 capture ECC involves utilizing cathode reactions to produce alkaline species capable of capturing CO2, and anode reactions for CO2 release4,5. ECC aims to enhance the energy efﬁciency of the capture and release processes compared to conventional amine scrubbing69, thus neces- sitating the selection or design of facile redox reactions that ensure high selectivity and low overpotential. In this regard, quinones and its derivatives have been extensively researched as effective redox-active CO2 carriers owing to their highly reversible redox kinetics10,11. Addi- tionally, various selectively occurring half-reactions have been coupled in ECC, such as HEROER Hydrogen Evolution ReactionOxygen Evo- lution Reaction and ORROER Oxygen Reduction ReactionOxygen Evolution Reaction12,13. Coupling the reduction reactions of base-CO2 adducts, such as carbonatescarbamates, with the OER can represent a promising approach to achieving the simultaneous electrochemical conversion Received: 6 November 2024 Accepted: 21 May 2025 Check for updates 1Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea. 2These authors contributed equally: Jeong Hyun Kim, Young In Jo, Jun Ho Jang. e-mail: nkitaesnu.ac.kr Nature Communications 2025 16:5038 1 1234567890:,; 1234567890:,; of CO2 and production of bases for CO2 capture14.

This approach, known as electrochemical reactive carbon capture eRCC, involves introducing electrons to chemisorbed CO2 species like carbamates and carbonates, resulting in CO2 reduction products e.g. CO, formate, etc. while restoring the basicity of the solution1517 Fig. 1a. However, the electrochemical reduction of carbonates and carbamates often exhibits low energy efﬁciency compared to ECC due to competing HER and sluggish kinetics.

In the conventional eRCC system, CO2 capture by the capturing agent precedes, and electrons are supplied to the cap- tured CO2 molecule to electrochemically reduce CO2 and simultaneously regen- erate the capturing agent. In contrast, in our new eRCC system initially supplies electrons to the substrate, followed by CO2 capture by the produced CO2-captur- able substrate. The captured CO2 then cascades into a CO2 conversion reaction, resulting in a CO2-substrate combined product. The colors of the liquids were selected to indicate their basicity: a light yellow color represents a neutral pH, while a pale blue color represents a basic pH. A darker blue color was chosen for halo- alkoxides to indicate that they are more basic than amine species. b Schematic representation of the electrochemical cyclic carbonate synthesis system. Through electrochemical deprotonation, halohydrin becomes capable of capturing CO2, leading to an intermediate that cascades into a cyclic carbonate. The leaving group detached from the conversion reaction is used at the counter electrode to synthesis halohydrin.

We thought that this could be achieved if the CO2 captured with electrochemically generated bases could spontaneously transform into stable, value-added chemicals without requiring further reduction of the chemisorbed CO2 species, the goal of combining CO2 capture via highly selective redox reactions with concurrent conversion could be achieved. For instance, deprotonation of an organic proton donor via cathodic HER could yield an organic base.

If the organic base-CO2 adduct formed during CO2 capture is reactive in subsequent intra- or inter-molecular reactions, we expect to construct a new electro- chemical system that captures and converts CO2 simultaneously through facile half-reactions. Halohydrins are potential candidates as organic proton donors for such systems, because halohydrins could yield halo-alkoxides upon deprotonation, which can react with CO2 to form halo-alkoxide-CO2 adducts. These adducts can then spontaneously transform into cyclic carbonates through intramolecular cyclization reactions18. This unique property of halohydrins has been leveraged in prior studies1922, using an equivalent amount of base to deprotonate the alcoholic protons of halohydrins under a CO2 atmosphere, thereby producing cyclic carbo- nates. Recently, our group proposed an electrochemical version where CO2 is ﬁrst captured as bicarbonate with electrochemically generated bases, which is then utilized as a CO2 donor and base for synthesizing ethylene carbonate in a subsequent step23. Based on this study, we explore the possibility that direct electrochemical deprotonation of halohydrins via HER could eliminate the need for a separate deproto- nating agent and an additional conversion step, thereby simplifying the overall process of CO2 capture and conversion using halohydrins. With this motivation, we report a new electrochemical strategy wherein an electrogenerated halo-alkoxide base captures CO2 and simultaneously transforms into cyclic carbonate. Speciﬁcally, the elec- trochemical reduction deprotonates halohydrins, concurrently gen- erating hydrogen and halo-alkoxides that function as CO2 capturing bases. The resulting halo-alkoxide-CO2 adducts undergo spontaneous intramolecular cyclization reactions to form cyclic carbonates Fig. 1a. We observed maximum Faradaic efﬁciency of nearly 100 for HER and an indirect Faradaic efﬁciency of nearly 100 for ethylene carbonate production under CO2 atmosphere, successfully validating our new concept. For efﬁcient ethylene carbonate production, careful selection of the halogen leaving group and supporting electrolyte cation were important. In addition, by facilitating CO2 mass transfer with gas dif- fusion electrodes and co-solvent, our system demonstrated operation under diluted CO2 concentrations 1.5 and 15 with ethylene carbo- nate production efﬁciency of 50 and up to 100, respectively. Pro- duction of various cyclic carbonates with vicinal halohydrins conﬁrmed the expandability and generality of this reaction scheme. Result Concept validation Figure 1b illustrates our scheme of chemical and electrochemical reactions. The design involves performing the HER at the cathode and the halogen evolution reaction at the anode. In the cathodic com- partment, electrochemical deprotonation of halohydrin simulta- neously generates hydrogen, cyclic carbonate, and a halide anion. An anion exchange membrane AEM can be introduced to prevent pro- duct crossover while facilitating the migration of the halide anion towards the anodic compartment24, where it replenishes the halide consumed at the anode as a reactant for the halogen evolution reac- tion. Our ionic circuit is more speciﬁcally described in Supplementary Fig. 1. Note that the produced halogen can be utilized as a reactant for the preparation of halohydrins. To validate the designed concept, bulk electrolysis was conducted using a two-compartment, membrane-separated cell Fig. 2a.

To validate the designed concept, bulk electrolysis was conducted using a two-compartment, membrane-separated cell Fig. 2a. In the cathodic compartment, a 0.5 M tetrabutylammonium chloride solution TBACl in chloroethanol was used as the catholyte, with CO2 gas bubbled through the solution to ensure saturation prior to the experiment. 2-Chloroethanol was chosen because it is an ethylene halohydrin derived from ethylene, the smallest molecule containing a CC double bond, providing a fundamental model for investigation. Pure halohydrin liquid was used as a solvent as well as a reactant to minimize the potential side reactions. For the anodic compartment, three different anolytes were evaluated: 0.5 M NaCl in water, 0.5 M TBACl in acetonitrile, and 0.5 M TBACl in chloroethanol. Ethylene carbonate was consistently detected in the catholyte in all cases Supplementary Fig. 2. The overall cell resistance was the lowest with the aqueous anolyte Supplementary Table 1, despite the presence of a liquid junction between the two solvents. In addition, when using an aqueous anolyte, supplying ethylene gas to the anodic compartment resulted in the generation of halohydrin through the reaction with the produced halogen and water Supplementary Fig. 3. Before selecting the aqueous anolyte, we assessed the potential risk of water penetra- tion through the membrane affecting the cathode reaction by com- paring a 2-chloroethanol catholyte with intentionally added water Supplementary Figs. 4, 5. The results showed that water crossover does not noticeably impact the cathode reaction. Using the aqueous anolyte with the CO2-saturated chloroethanol catholyte, we tested three cathodes: Pt, Ni, and Au plates. Post-elec- trolysis, we observed high selectivity for HER at the cathode, along with the production of ethylene carbonate Fig. 2b. The HER faradaic efﬁciency was nearly 100 for Pt and Ni, while slightly lower for Au 90. To quantify ethylene carbonates yield, we introduced the term indirect Faradaic efﬁciency iF.E., deﬁned as: Indirect Faradaic Efficiency iF:E: ð Þ Total produced ethylene carbonate mol Supplied electrons mol 100 ð1Þ The concept of Faradaic efﬁciency typically describes the efﬁ- ciency of charge transfer in an electrochemical system. However, in the electrochemical synthesis of ethylene carbonate, no change occurs in the redox state of the involved atoms. Instead, ethylene carbonate is formed indirectly via chemical reactions involving electrochemically generated species. To account for this, we deﬁne iF.E. as a measure of the charge utilization efﬁciency leading to ethylene carbonate forma- tion. The maximum theoretical iF.E. corresponds to the direct elec- troreduction of the halohydrins O-H bond, as illustrated in Fig. 1b, where one molecule of ethylene carbonate is produced per supplied electron. Conversely, the indirect Faradaic efﬁciency for ethylene carbonate was highest with Au 70 and similar for Pt and Ni 60. Considering Aus efﬁcacy as a catalyst for the selective reduction of CO2 to CO25, the slight reduction in HER efﬁciency is likely due to the undesired CO2 reduction reaction. Additionally, the selective binding of CO2",

Considering Aus efﬁcacy as a catalyst for the selective reduction of CO2 to CO25, the slight reduction in HER efﬁciency is likely due to the undesired CO2 reduction reaction. Additionally, the selective binding of CO2 on the Au electrode26 might contribute to the increased pro- duction of ethylene carbonate. Importantly, in all cases, the sum of the Faradaic efﬁciency for HER and indirect Faradaic efﬁciency for ethy- lene carbonate exceeded 100 and isotopic labeling experiments verifying that hydrogen is sourced from electrochemical deprotona- tion of -OH Supplementary Fig. 6. These results indicate that ethylene carbonate production is a consequence of alkoxide anion generation during HER. In the absence of CO2 in the catholyte, ethylene oxide was produced Supplementary Figs. 7, 8, which further conﬁrmed the generation of alkoxide anion27. Notably, the difference between the Faradaic efﬁciency for H2 and the indirect Faradaic efﬁciency for ethylene carbonate correlates with the formation of ethylene oxide. This correlation arises because the production of H2 indicates the generation of halo-alkoxide, with one halo-alkoxide formed per elec- tron, and the difference corresponds to the conversion of halo- alkoxide to ethylene carbonate via self-ring closure. Although ethylene oxide was not quantiﬁed due to its volatility, it was detected in the Article https:doi.org10.1038s41467-025-60354-8 Nature Communications 2025 16:5038 3 post-electrolysis solution containing CO2 Supplementary Fig. 7. However, its concentration was substantially lower compared to the solution without CO2. Additionally, there was no signiﬁcant presence of products other than ethylene carbonate and ethylene oxide. Effect of electrolyte and current on EC selectivity To investigate the effect of surrounding cations on ethylene carbonate production, we tested three different supporting electrolytes. Tetra- alkylammonium cations resulted in signiﬁcantly higher indirect Far- adaic efﬁciency, while the protonated amidine cation showed considerably lower efﬁciency Fig. 2c. Among the tetraalk- ylammonium cations, the indirect Faradaic efﬁciency increased with the size of the cation. We hypothesized that a cation-alkoxide inter- action could explain this observed difference in efﬁciency. To explore the extent of cation-alkoxide interaction, we compared the rate of ethylene oxide production in each cationic environment. 2-Chloroethanol was chemically deprotonated using organic hydro- xide in the presence of different cations, and the amount of ethylene oxide produced was measured at intervals. The results showed that the rate of ethylene oxide formation was much higher in the presence of tetraalkylammonium cations compared to the protonated amidine cation Fig. 2d. This indicates that the interaction between tetraalk- ylammonium cations and the alkoxide is much weaker than that of the protonated amidine cation, leading to faster ring closure. From this data, we think that the higher ethylene carbonate efﬁciency with tet- raalkylammoniums is due to the weaker cation-alkoxide interaction, which would facilitate easier insertion of CO2. We also investigated the effect of alkoxide production rate on ethylene carbonate production efﬁciency by varying the current den- sity Fig. 2e. The three different current densities resulted in similar indirect Faradaic efﬁciencies, regardless of their values.",

The three different current densities resulted in similar indirect Faradaic efﬁciencies, regardless of their values. This suggests that the CO2-alkoxide adduction is sufﬁciently fast and that the rate of ethylene carbonate production is determined by the alkoxide production rate.

Speciﬁcally, we observed that using 2- bromo- or 2-iodo-ethanol led to the cathodic reduction of the C-X bond instead of HER, resulting in the production of ethylene or ethane as side products Supplementary Fig. 9. Cyclic voltammetry with catholytes containing the three different haloalcohols showed no distinct peak for 2-chloroethanol, while 2-bromoethanol and 2-iodoethanol displayed peaks around 1.5 to 1.75 V Fig. 3a. Gas product analysis revealed substantial production of ethylene and ethane with 2-bromoethanol and 2-iodoethanol Fig. 3b. The sharp peak at 0.3 V in the voltammogram of 2-iodoethanol is attributed to the I3 -I- redox pair28. These results suggest that C-Br and C-I bonds are more prone to electrochemical reduction compared to C-Cl bonds29. Interestingly, the indirect Faradaic efﬁciency of ethylene carbonate production using 2-bromo- and 2-iodo-ethanol decreased, but not as much as expected based on the Faradaic efﬁciency of HER Fig. 3c. Notably, while the Faradaic efﬁciency of H2 with 2-iodo-ethanol was near zero, ethylene carbonate was still observed 20. This can be explained by the fact that the cyclization reaction does not require direct electron injection. Although electrons are consumed for ethy- lene and ethane production, alkoxide or hydroxide can be generated, which triggers deprotonation and cyclization of haloalcohols Sup- plementary Fig. 10. However, considering that HER requires one electron per one alkoxide or hydroxide but ethane and ethylene pro- duction require two electrons Supplementary Fig. 9, and taking into accounts the atomic efﬁciency of haloalcohols, we found that chlor- oethanol is the most suitable substrate. CO2 capture and EC synthesis using GDE system To test the applicability of this system for actual CO2 capturing circumstances, we lowered the CO2 concentration to 15 and 1.5. Directly injecting diluted CO2 steam into the catholyte resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in the indirect Faradaic efﬁciency of ethylene carbonate Fig. 4a. To enhance CO2 supply, we employed a gas diffusion electrode GDE to deliver CO2 directly to the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte Fig. 4b. Figure 4a con- ﬁrms that using the GDE increases the indirect Faradaic efﬁciency compared to the injection method, achieving efﬁcient ethylene carbonate synthesis with over 50 even at 1.5 CO2 concentration. The GDE conﬁguration also enabled operation at higher current densities Supplementary Fig. 11. Figure 4c shows the indirect Faradaic efﬁciency at current densities of 10, 25, and 50 mAcm², comparing 100 and 15 CO2. Unlike under 100 CO2 conditions, increasing the current density under 15 CO2 decreased the indirect Faradaic efﬁciency of ethylene carbonate, indicating that CO2 becomes the limiting substrate for the cyclization reaction Fig. 4c. Further lowering the CO2 concentration to 1.5 at 50 mAcm² also showed that efﬁciency is controlled by the CO2 concentration Supplementary Fig. 12. These results mean that as CO2 is the lim-",

These results mean that as CO2 is the lim- iting substrate at high current densities and in dilute CO2 streams, enhancing CO2 supply is crucial for efﬁcient ethylene carbonate production. Introducing the GDE enabled us to synthesize ethylene carbonate with a comparably high yield by directly capturing CO2 from a mixed gas source. We also selected speciﬁc conditions to show the operational stability of our system: a current density of 50 mAcm2 and CO2 concentration of 15, which is the typical ﬂue gas concentrations from coal-ﬁred power plant30. Figure 4d shows the indirect Faradaic efﬁciency and concentration of ethylene carbonate synthesized in the electrolyte, and the cell voltage measured during electrolysis. The constant indirect Faradaic efﬁciency shows the stability of our system. The concentration of ethylene carbonate consistently increased during electrolysis, reaching 0.09 M after 5 h of operation. Expansion of substrate scope A variety of cyclic carbonates are utilized as value-added chemicals, particularly as polymer precursors31,32, lubricants33, solvents34, and additives in battery electrolytes35. Since our system relies on facile HER on halohydrin substrates, our strategy could potentially be applied to synthesize various cyclic carbonates. The linear sweep voltammo- grams of these vicinal chlorohydrin candidates appeared similar to that of 2-chloroethanol, exhibiting HER onset around 2.0 V and no noticeable reduction peak Supplementary Fig. 13, indicating the viability of expanding the substrate scope. Additionally, H2 production from vicinal halohydrin was conﬁrmed with gas chromatography Supplementary Fig. 14. We conducted bulk electrolysis using a two- compartment, membrane-separated cell.

In this case, improving CO2 solubility and diffusivity could be effective strategies. Following this assumption, we introduced acetonitrile as a diluent for chlorohydrins due to its high CO2 solubility36,37 and low viscosity38 Supplementary Table 2 and 3, diluting until the chlorohydrins con- centrations reached 1.0 M to ensure sufﬁcient reactant availability while leveraging acetonitriles advantageous properties. Since diffu- sion coefﬁcients are inversely proportional to the viscosity of the medium, acetonitrile, which has a viscosity one-tenth that of 2-chlor- oethanol, would have high CO2 diffusivity. As the gold line indicates Fig. 5, the corresponding cyclic carbonates were successfully syn- thesized with signiﬁcantly enhanced yields, suggesting the expand- ability and generality of our method. Moreover, in the acetonitrile solvent, both Faradaic efﬁciency of HER and the indirect Faradaic efﬁciency of ethylene carbonate production reached near 100. The increase in ethylene carbonate production efﬁciency using acetonitrile was also conﬁrmed with the GDE conﬁguration and 15 CO2. Speciﬁcally, the indirect Faradaic efﬁciency of ethylene carbonate increased from 46 to 78 Supplementary Fig. 15 when employing acetonitrile compared to without it. Again, in both cases, the HER Faradaic efﬁciency was near 100 Supplementary Fig. 16, suggesting that acetonitrile does not affect the electrochemical reaction but rather the subsequent alkoxide-CO2 adduction either by its high CO2 solubility Supplementary Fig. 17 or low viscosity. Discussion In summary, this cascading reaction investigated here offers two key advantages: CO2 capture through highly selective redox reactions and simultaneous conversion to a value-added chemical without additional processes. HER on 2-chloroethanol occurs with high selectivity, and CO2- inserted ethylene carbonate is produced through a series of domino reactions. By ensuring the high selectivity in O-H bond deprotonation, maintaining the reactivity of alkoxide intermediates, and enabling efﬁ- cient mass transfer of CO2, the process exhibit Faradaic efﬁciencies of up to 100 for both ethylene carbonate and hydrogen.

Methods Chemicals and materials Reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further puriﬁcation. Electrodes included platinum foil 0.025-mm thick, 99.99 metal basis, nickel foil 0.1-mm thick, 99.5 metal basis, gold foil 0.1-mm thick, 99.9975 metal basis, and glassy carbon plates 3 mm 25 mm 25 mm, all purchased from Alfa Aesar. For electrolytes, 2-chloroethanol 99, 2-bromoethanol 95, and 2-iodoethanol 99 were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. Supporting electrolytes included tetrabutylammonium chloride 97.0 and tetramethylammonium chloride 97.0. A hydrochloric salt of 1,8-diazabicyclo4.3.0non-5- ene DBN was synthesized in lab due to its commercial unavailability. This synthesis involved mixing DBN purum, 98.0, from Sigma Aldrich with diethyl ether 99.50, from DAEJUNG Chemicals Metals and adding ethereal HCl solution under vigorous stirring in an inert atmosphere, resulting in a dry white solid after 2 h. The resulting salt was used without further puriﬁcation. For aqueous electrolytes, high purity deionized DI water 18.2 MΩcm and sodium chloride 99 from DAEJUNG Chemicals Metals were used. Anion exchange membranes were sourced from ASTOM NEOSEPTA-AHA, AFN and stored in 0.5 M aqueous sodium chloride solution. Speciﬁcation of anion exchange membranes is provided in Supplementary Table 4. Acetonitrile 99.50 dried with molecular sieves 3 Å, 116 in. rod was used as the electrolyte solvent in the experiments shown in Figs. 3a, 5, Supplementary Figs. 1, 2, 8, 10 and 11. Both the acetonitrile and molecular sieves were purchased from DAEJUNG Chemicals Metals. Preparation of electrodes 1. Metal foil electrodes: Pt, Ni, and Au foil electrodes were used as received. Post-experiment, they were cleaned by sonication in acetone. 2. Gas diffusion electrodes: GDEs were fabricated by sputtering a nickel layer onto PTFE membrane ﬁlters Aspire laminated ePTFE membrane, QL822, Sterlitech Corporation. PTFE membranes were afﬁxed to a 4 silicon wafer using Kapton tape. Nickel layers were sputtered on the polypropylene side using an SRN120 SPUTTER at 500 W RF power for 1402 s, resulting in a 300 nm thickness. 3. Glassy carbon electrodes: Glassy carbon plates Alfa Aesar, 3 mm 25 mm 25 mm were polished with diamond paste and rinsed with acetone before each use. They were cleaned post- experiment by sonication in acetone. 4. Dimensionally stable anodes DSA: Dimensionally stable anodes DSA were created by brush-coating iridium ink onto titanium plates. The ink was prepared by dissolving IrCl4xH2O 99.9, Sigma-Aldrich in 2-propanol 99, Sigma-Aldrich. After coating, the electrodes were sintered at 500 C.

Metal foils served as the working electrode; exposed area controlled to 2.25 cm2 Supplementary Fig. 18. The catholyte, a liquid halohydrin, served both as a reactant and a sol- vent to minimize side reactions and included 0.5 M organic salts as a supporting electrolyte. In Fig. 5, acetonitrile 99.50, from DAEJUNG Chemicals Metals dried with molecular sieves was used as the solvent. TBACl was used as the supporting electrolyte unless otherwise noted Fig. 2c. Electrolytes were prepared immediately before each electrolysis experiment. Argon 99.999 or CO2 99.999 gas from SINJIN GAS TECH CO. was bubbled into the catholyte for 25 min at 250 sccm before electrolysis. In the anode compartment, an aqueous halide solution and a glassy carbon anode facilitated the halohydrin evolution reaction. Ethylene gas was bubbled into the anolyte during electrolysis at 20 sccm as needed. Bulk electrolysis was performed at various current densities in a two-electrode system, with the cell sealed to prevent gas loss. Gas products were analyzed by gas chromatography after passing 5 C of charge, and liquid products were analyzed by NMR after passing 30 C of charge. Experiments were conducted at room temperature approximately 25 C using a potentiostat. VSP-300, Bio-Logic Science Instruments. For the ﬂow cell, a GDE served as the working electrode, and a DSA plate was the counter electrode. Electrodes were masked with gaskets to control the exposed area to 0.42 cm² Supplementary Fig. 18. Liquid ﬂow was driven by a peristaltic pump EMP-600A at 5 mLmin, and gas was supplied to the backside of the GDE at 20 sccm during the electrolysis. Bulk electrolysis was conducted at various current den- sities in a two-electrode system at room temperature using a poten- tiostat CHI600. Liquid products were analyzed after passing 30 C of charge. Product analysis Gas products were analyzed using a Clarus 580 Gas Chromatography instrument. A 0.1 mL of gas was sampled after electrolysis and injected into the instrument. Calibration curves were generated using a com- mercial standard gas sample from SINJIN GAS TECH CO., containing H2, CO, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, with N2 as the balance Supplementary Fig. 19. Liquid products were analyzed by NMR spectroscopy using internal standards. After electrolysis, the catholyte was stored in a refrigerator to prevent ethylene oxide loss. Benzyl benzoate 5 mmol, 99.0, Sigma Aldrich was added as an internal standard, and the solution volume was adjusted to 10 mL with chloroform 99.5, DAE- JUNG Chemicals Metals. The solution was then mixed with CDCl3 99.8 atom D, Alfa Aesar in a 1:1 ratio and analyzed by NMR. Cyclic carbonates were quantiﬁed by comparing peak areas with benzyl benzoate.

These hydroxide solutions were then diluted to a concentration of 0.5 M by adding methanol HPLC Grade, 99.8 from Alfa Aesar. A DBNHOH methanol solution was prepared by combining 0.5 M DBN with 0.5 M of deionized water in methanol. TBACl, TMACl, and synthesized DBNHCl salts were prepared in 0.5 M deuterated methanol CH3OD, 99.8 atom D, Sigma Aldrich. A mixture of 0.6 mL 0.5 M TBACl- CH3OD solution, 0.2 mL of 0.5 M TBAOH-CH3OH solution, and 6.7 μL of 2-chloroethanol equimolar to TBAOH was analyzed by NMR immediately after mixing. Subsequent measurements were conducted at 1-h intervals for the same sample. The same procedure was followed for TMA and DBNH analogs. For quantiﬁcation, a commercial ethylene oxide standard reference sample 1.13 M in methanol was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. A 0.1 mL of commercial ethylene oxide reference was mixed with 0.1 mL of a 0.5 M TBACl-2-chloroethanol solution and 0.6 mL of CDCl3 to resemble the composition of the prepared samples.

Catalyst design remains one pivotal element in addressing this challenge. Here, eﬃcient CuCo dual active sites embedded in hollow cobalt oxide nanoboxes are created for the electrocatalytic low-concentration NO reduction reaction NORR. Cu-modiﬁed cobalt oxide Cu-Co3O4 and its heterophase interface with copper oxide Cu-Co3O4CuO both exhibit over 93 Faraday eﬃciency for NH3 synthesis, with a yield reaching up to 59.10 µg h1 mgcat 1 at 0.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode by utilizing simulated industrial NO exhaust 1 vol as the feedstock, surpassing those of pure cobalt oxide and some reported catalysts. Theoretical calculations and NO temperature- programmed desorption experiments demonstrate that the incorporation of Cu signiﬁcantly enhances NO adsorption and reduces the energy barrier of the rate-determining step. The integration of Cu-Co3O4 and Cu-Co3O4CuO within the cathode of the ZnNO battery demonstrates a notable power density of 2.02 mW cm2, highlighting a propitious direction for investigating highly eﬃcient conversion of low-concentration NO exhaust gas. 1.

Given the signiﬁcantly lower NO concentrations 5 vol derived from industrial emissions and plasma-activated nitrogen, the ex- ploration of low-concentration or industrially simulated NO ex- haust electrocatalytic conversion holds practical importance.31 Although Cu is the most active metal catalyst for NORR at high concentrations, its Faraday eﬃciency is less than 10 at low concentrations.32 This is mainly because the mass transfer and adsorption of NO gas on the catalyst surface becomes diﬃcult Adv.

Subsequently, researchers tried to develop various strategies to design catalysts to address these two chal- lenges, including defect engineering,33 strain engineering,34 and composition regulation. Zhangs group achieved eﬃcient conversion of low-concentration NO by constructing porous car- bon on the surface of Cu nanowire arrays to improve NO diﬀu- sion and coverage.35 Considering that metallic Co and its oxides are the active components for NO conversion and NH3 synthesis, we recently implanted Ru into Co nanoparticles to induce phase transition to enhance NO adsorption capacity, thereby promot- ing NORR activity.36,37 Porous micronanostructures character- ized by intricate hollow conﬁgurations maximize active site ex- posure, thereby amplifying mass diﬀusion and culminating in superior electrocatalytic activity.38 Therefore, the strategic de- sign and synthesis of electrocatalysts with NO adsorption capaci- ties within the active components ensconced in hollow structures represent a pioneering pathway toward a novel paradigm in elec- trocatalytic NORR for ammonia synthesis.

As the concentration of the metal salt in- creased, the material transitioned into a heterogeneous structure comprising Cu-Co3O4 and CuO samples obtained at a Cu salt concentration of 2.5 mM were labeled as Cu-Co3O4CuO. The two experimental conditions actually represent the same cation exchange approach, with the only variation being the concentra- tion of Cu metal salt 0.625 mM for Cu-Co3O4 and 2.5 mM for Cu-Co3O4CuO. The subsequent calcination was applied to all samples as the ﬁnal step. Therefore, the only variable across sam- ples was the Cu loading amount, with low concentrations pro- ducing Cu-doped Co3O4 phases and high concentrations yield- ing Cu-Co3O4CuO heterostructures. The results indicated that the hollow structure of Co3O4 was well maintained without ob- vious aggregation and collapse, as evidenced from an open NB Figure 2a; Figure S6a,b, Supporting Information. TEM images further demonstrated the hollow structure with a wall thickness of 20 nm Figure 2b. Notably, the surface of the nanocubes was assembled from ultraﬁne oxide nanoparticles, establishing a porous network between them that was conducive to promot- ing the exposure of active sites and enhancing substance dif- fusion Figure 2c.

In the SAED pattern, additional diﬀraction information was successively correlated with the 002 and 20-2 crystal plane of CuO from the inner to the outer regions. These results further conﬁrmed the formation of the Cu-Co3O4CuO heterophase structures. Inductively coupled plasma optical emis- sion spectroscopy results indicated that the CuCo atomic ratios in Cu-Co3O4 and Cu-Co3O4CuO were 0.19:1 and 1.47:1, respec- tively, and EDS also conﬁrmed the presence of these elements Table S1; Figure S14, Supporting Information.

Compared with Co3O4 NBs, the binding energy of Co 2p in Cu-Co3O4 NBs and Cu-Co3O4CuO NBs negatively shifted by 0.6 eV, indicating electron transfer from Co to Cu atoms upon the introduction of Cu elements.43 Consequently, the integration of Cu into Co3O4 NBs led to a notable cooperative charge eﬀect, modifying their electronic conﬁgurations and possibly boosting electrochemical activity. In the Cu 2p XPS spectra Figure S18b, Supporting Infor- mation, strong satellite peak signals were observed, which were typical characteristics of Cu2. X-ray absorption near-edge structure XANES and X-ray ab- sorption ﬁne structure EXAFS were examined for investigat- ing the coordination environment and electronic structure in- formation of electrocatalysts. Compared with Co3O4 NBs, the absorption edges in the Co K-edge spectra of Cu-Co3O4 NBs and Cu-Co3O4CuO NB shift toward higher energy, indicating an increase in the oxidation state of Co by introducing Cu atoms Figure 3d. The corresponding EXAFS spectra of Co K- edge show that the three catalysts have similar coordination en- vironments, indicating that Cu modiﬁcation does not signiﬁ- cantly alter the coordination of Co atoms Figure 3e. Speciﬁ- cally, the three main peaks in the EXAFS spectrum are attributed to CoO, octahedral CoCo and tetrahedral CoCoCu bonds, respectively.44 In the Cu K-edge XANES spectra Figure 3f, com- pared with the CuO reference, the shoulder peak at 8985 eV of Cu-Co3O4 NBs disappears, and the adsorption edge shifts to higher energy, indicating that Cu implantation results in a dis- tinct state rather than the formation of independent CuO. In Cu-Co3O4CuO NBs, the adsorption edge is only slightly more positive than that of the CuO reference, accompanied by the ap- pearance of a shoulder peak, suggesting the formation of a het- erophase interface. In the corresponding Cu K-edge EXAFS spec- tra Figure 3g, the Cu-Co3O4 NBs sample only exhibits peaks at 1.54 and 2.50 Å, corresponding to CuO and CuCu bonds, re- spectively. The disappearance of the peak at 2.93 Å indicates the diﬀerences in their coordination environments from the CuO ref- erence and the successful insertion of Cu into Co3O4 NBs. How- ever, a small peak emerges at 2.93 Å for Cu-Co3O4CuO NBs, suggesting the formation of CuO. The wavelet transform WT of k3-weighted Co K-edge EXAFS spectra reﬂects information about Co-O and Co-Co bonds that align with the EXAFS spectra Figure 3hj. These results indicate that Cu implantation eﬀec- tively regulates the electronic structure and coordination environ- ment of Co3O4 NBs.

Furthermore, it was found that the Cu-Co3O4CuO NBs with heterophase interface also exhibited NH3 synthesis performance comparable to Cu-Co3O4 NBs Faraday eﬃciency, 93.19; yield rate, 59.10 μg h1 mgcat 1, surpassing both pure Co3O4 NBs and some catalysts in the literature under similar conditions Figures S28 and S29; Table S2, Supporting Informa- tion. These electrochemical experimental results indicated that the CuCo dual-site catalyst can enhance NORR performances through a bimetallic synergy eﬀect.45 Subsequently, we delved into the impact of diﬀerent CuCo ratios in the Cu-Co3O4 NBs and Cu-Co3O4CuO NBs on the NORR performance Figures S30S32, Supporting Information. As the Cu content increased, NORR performance increased ﬁrst and then decreased. There was no signiﬁcant decay in the NH3 production rate and Faraday eﬃciency on Cu-Co3O4 NBs at 0.4 V vs. RHE over six cycles, demonstrating the stability of the materials Figure 4c; Figures S33 and S34, Supporting Information. To obtain rigorous stabil- ity data, we conducted a 120-h NORR stability test at 0.4 V vs. RHE Figure S35, Supporting Information. The results showed negligible current decay, with the Faraday eﬃciency and yield of NH3 maintained at 57.38 and 34.06 μg h1 mgcat 1, respectively. Post-stability test characterizations revealed that Cu-Co3O4 NBs retained their original phase structure and composition Figure S36; Table S3, Supporting Information. The performance degra- dation observed may be attributed to localized microstructural changes in the catalysts, as evidenced by TEM analysis showing partial structural collapse of Cu-Co3O4 NBs Figure S37, Support- ing Information. A range of meticulously designed experiments was executed under diverse conditions to validate the source of the NH3 derived from NORR, unaﬀected by external inﬂuences Figure 4d; Figure S38, Supporting Information.

Both Cu-Co3O4 NBs and Cu-Co3O4CuO NBs exhibited signiﬁcantly stronger NO adsorption capabilities compared to pure Co3O4 NBs, partic- ularly evidenced by prominent chemical adsorption peaks 200 400 C, indicating that the incorporation of Cu signiﬁcantly en- hanced the NO adsorption capacity in cobalt oxides. To elucidate the intricacies of the catalytic mechanism, den- sity functional theory DFT calculations were conducted. Based on the physical characterization results, the Co3O4311, Cu- Co3O4311, and Cu-Co3O4311CuO002 surfaces were chosen for subsequent theoretical studies Figure S45, Supporting Infor- mation. The adsorption energies of NO on diﬀerent adsorption sites of the three catalysts were considered Figure S46, Support- ing Information.

These results are in excellent agreement with the NO- TPD experimental results.

The higher energy level for Cu 3d orbital of Cu atom near Co adsite in Cu-Co3O4CuO compared to that in Cu-Co3O4 indicates the electron transfer from Co to Cu, which leads to the stronger orbital interaction between Co and N atoms in Cu- Co3O4CuO.

Building on insights from our earlier research and supported by recent theoretical investigations,36,46 the ﬁrst protonation step from NO to NOH is frequently identiﬁed as a pivotal factor and the potential-determining step in the NORR process. As a result, the Cu-Co3O4 demonstrates a signiﬁcantly lower energy barrier 1.07 eV compared to the Cu-Co3O4CuO 1.18 eV and Co3O4 1.31 eV, highlighting a notable improvement in catalytic eﬃciency for the Cu-Co3O4 and Cu-Co3O4CuO.

During the battery discharge process, the Zn-NO electrochemistry implements electrochem- ical NO reduction driven by Zn dissolution. Compared to con- ventional electrolytic NO-to-ammonia conversion processes, the Zn-NO battery demonstrates speciﬁc advantages including self- powered operation, simultaneous electricity generation and valu- able ammonia production, making it particularly suitable for portable and distributed ammonia synthesis applications Table S4, Supporting Information. This setup aimed to explore the synergy of electricity generation, NO removal, and NH3 produc- tion within a single system Figure 6a.

Zn-NO batteries can maintain their function by switching reaction paths or system design when NH3 generation halts. Speciﬁcally, if NO is depleted, oxygen or air can be intro- duced as a substrate to switch to Zn-air batteries mode, but this transition requires a dual-functional cathode design. This emerg- ing Zn-NO battery shows application potential in areas such as atmospheric pollutant control, distributed ammonia production, and temporary power supply. 3. Conclusion In summary, eﬃcient CuCo dual-sites in hollow cobalt oxide nanoboxes have been developed for the electrocatalytic reduc- tion of low-concentration NO to NH3. Both Cu-Co3O4 NBs and Cu-Co3O4CuO NBs with Cu modiﬁcation exhibit Faraday eﬃ- ciency greater than 93 and ammonia yields up to 59.10 μg h1 mgcat 1 at 0.4 V vs. RHE, surpassing that of 75.29 and 24.05 μg h1 mgcat 1 for the bare Co3O4 NBs. DFT calculations and NO-TPD results demonstrate that Cu modiﬁcation enhances NO adsorption and activation while lowering the energy barrier of the rate-determining step. In a proof-of-concept demonstration, the assembled Zn-NO batteries utilizing Cu-Co3O4 NBs and Cu- Co3O4CuO NBs as electrode materials showcase power densi- ties of 1.58 and 2.02 mW cm2, respectively, with an NH3 yield of 17.66 μg h1 mgcat 1. In this integrated system, NH3 generation, electrical energy output, and NO gas utilization could be achieved simultaneously. This work provides a new strategy for the design of catalysts for electrocatalytic upgrading of low-concentration NO exhaust gas.
